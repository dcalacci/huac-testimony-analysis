Mr. JEROME. Victor Jeremy Jerome.
Mr. WooD. Mr. Jerome, you need not stand unless you wish to.
Mr. JEROME (seating himself). 320 Second Avenue, New York City.
Mr. TAVENNER. When and where were you born ?
Mr. JEROME. I was born October 12, 1896, in Poland.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you a naturalized American citizen ?
Mr. JEROME. I am, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. When and in what court were you naturalized
Mr. JEROME. I was naturalized in January 1928 in New York City,southern district court.
Mr. TAVENNER. Under what name were you naturalized ?
Mr. JEROME. Jerome Isaac Romain.
Mr. TAVENNER. How do you spell Romain?
Mr. JEROME. R-o-m-a-i-n.
Mr. TAVENNER. I believe your name has been legally changed?
Mr. JEROME. My name has been legally changed in 1944, Decem-ber 1.
Mr. TAVENNER. Have you used any other name, other than yourpresent legal name and the name of Jerome Isaac Romain ?
Mr. JEROME. Yes; the surname of Roman.
Mr. TAVENNER. R-o-m-a-n?
Mr. JEROME. That is right.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you please state where you have resided since1930 and for the approximate periods of time ?
Mr. JEROME. My place of residence permanently has been the cityof New York since 1930.
Mr. TAVENNER. During that period of time did you reside temporarily at other places?
Mr. JEROME. I refuse to answer the question in the exercise of myright against possible self-incrimination. I base myself on the privilege afforded me by the fifth amendment.
Mr. TAVENNER. How would your refusal to answer the questionof where you had resided tend to incriminate you?
Mr. JEROME. It might lead to an area involving possible self-incrimination.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you state to this committee your reasons forbelieving that it would bring you into such an area as you describe,so that the committee may have some information upon which to actor to judge whether or not it would tend to incriminate you, theanswering of that question ?
Mr. JEROME. I feel that the answering of that question would violatemy right to exercise the privilege under the fifth amendment.
Mr. TAVENNER. So you decline, as I understand it, to advise thecommittee in what manner or any circumstances which would enablethem to determine whether or not your refusal to answer the questionof the places of your residence would tend to incriminate you ?
Mr. JEROME. I am not motivated by any desire not to advise thecommittee, but I feel that I have the right to exercise the privilegeagainst self-incrimination.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Jerome, will you briefly outline for the committee your educational background
Mr. JEROME. I had my grammar school education and my sec-ondary school education in England. I had my college education inthe United States. I am a graduate of the New York University.COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY57
Mr. MOULDER. Will you designate specifically the schools?
Mr. JEROME. I attended here the College of the City of New York,and later the Washington Square College of the New York University, where I graduated in 1930.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you outline briefly for the committee youroccupational background?
Mr. JEROME. I was a bookkeeper for years. I was
Mr. WooD. Bookkeeper, did you say ?
Mr. JEROME. Yes. I was a tutor, private. For a time I taught in ahigh school, Erasmus High School, as a teacher in training.
Mr. TAVENNER. Where is that located?
Mr. JEROME. In the city of New York. Is the question relative toeducation or general occupation?
Mr. TAVENNER. What has been your occupational background?
Mr. JEROME. For a brief while I was also printing salesman, thatis, soliciting printing.
Mr. TAVENNER. By whom were you employed?
Mr. JEROME. I was not employed. I was really self-employed, oncommission, in the main. For a brief while I think perhaps-I don'tbelieve I ever was on salary. If I had a connection with a printer itwas also on commission.
Mr. TAVENNER. During what period of time were you so engaged?
Mr. JEROME. I would say about 1929-30. Since then I also havebeen a writer and an editor, which has been my major occupation.
Mr. WooD. Is that true now ?
Mr. JEROME. That is true now.
Mr. KEARNEY. Writer and editor for whom?
Mr. JEROME. I must decline to answer this question on the groundsI have previously given, the privilege against self-incrimination.
Mr. WALTER. Yes; but you voluntarily stated that you were awriter and, as I understand the law, you can't invoke privilege inorder to avoid discussing the details of that which you volunteer.
Mr. JEROME. I believe that I am exercising my right as I see it andunderstand it in claiming the privilege.
Mr. WooD. And you still decline to answer the question for thereason given ?
Mr. JEROM E. For the reason given.
Mr. TAVENNER. Have you engaged at any time in the teaching pro-fession other than the teaching in the high school and the tutoringwhich you have already described?
Mr. JEROME. I refuse to answer that question, claiming the privilegeagainst possible self-incrimination.
Mr. WooD. Mr. Jerome, you stated a while ago that you were engagedfor a time in teaching, tutoring.
Mr. JEROME. Other than that I have described, he said.
Mr. MOULDER. Mr. Chairman, may I ask a question?
Mr. WOOD. Mr. Moulder.
Mr. MOULDER. What subjects do you teach, specialize in?
Mr. JEROME. I do not teach now.
Mr. MOULDER. What subjects did you teach
Mr. JEROME. It was English.
Mr. KEARNEY. What subjects did you write on58COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY
Mr. JEROME. I want to answer the other question, please. The sub-jects that I refer to involve the teaching of English. The subjects Iwrote on, I decline to answer that question, claiming the privilegeagainst possible self-incrimination.
Mr. KEARNEY. Mr. Chairman, the witness has already testifiedvoluntarily that he is a writer and editor.
Mr. DOYLE. May I ask what you are editor of, what magazine, whatpaper, what pamphlet, what book?
Mr. JEROME. I decline to answer the question, invoking my privilegeafforded me by the Constitution.
Mr. DOYE. When were you an editor, what years?
Mr. JEROME. I decline to answer the question for the same reason.
Mr. DOYLE. Where were you an editor, what city ?
Mr. JEROME. I decline to answer the question for the same reason.
Mr. DOYLE. Where did you live when you were an editor?
Mr. JEROME. I decline to answer the question for the same reason.
Mr. POTTER. Mr. Jerome, how could you possibly incriminate yourself by giving the committee the dates you were active as editor ?
Mr. JEROME. The privilege I claim does not make it incumbent uponme to answer that question.
Mr. DOYLE. May I ask this: How could it possibly incriminate youto tell your fellow Americans-because you were naturalized in 1928how could it possibly incriminate you to tell us what books or papersyou wrote ? You have said you were' an editor. I assume you werean editor in this country. How could it incriminate you to state whatyou wrote ? I assume you are proud of them.
Mr. JEROME. The situation is not of my creation, members of thecommittee. I feel there is justification in the statement made recentlyby Justice Black, that to answer one question for the congressionalcommittee is to rob yourself of the privilege afforded you by theConstitution.
Mr. WALTER. Of course in the position taken by Justice Black therest of the Court did not concur.
Mr. JEROME. True, but I have a high regard for that position, and Iwould like to identify myself with the recognition of that situation.
Mr. KEARNEY. You have a high regard for that position because, inthe first instance, it covers your own course. Have you ever written forany Communist publication ?
Mr. JEROME. I refuse to answer that question, claiming the privilegeunder the constitutional right.
Mr. MOULDER. Did you write any articles under any name otherthan your own?
Mr. JEROME. I refuse to answer the question on the same grounds.
Mr. TAVENNER. You have stated that you were an editor. Were youassociated, in the early 1930's with the publication New Pioneer?
Mr. JEROME. I decline to answer the question in exercise of my rightagainst self-incrimination.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you associated in any capacity with the publication known as New Masses?
Mr. JEROME. I decline to answer the question on the same grounds.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you the editor of the publication the Communist?
Mr. JEROME. I decline to answer the question on the same grounds.COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY59
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you associated with the publication MainStream?
Mr. JEROME. I decline to answer the question, invoking the privi-lege against self-incrimination.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was your official position, if any, with thepublication Political Affairs?
Mr. JEROME. I decline to answer the question, invoking the priv-ilege against self-incrimination.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you know if Mr. Joseph Fields was at any timeeditor of New Century Publishers, Inc.?
Mr. JEROME. I decline to answer the question in exercise of myright against self-incrimination.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was Lement U. Harris one of the editors of thatpublication ?
Mr. JEROME. I decline to answer that question on the grounds ofpossible self-incrimination.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you also an editor of that publication?
Mr. JEROME. I decline to answer the question for the given reason.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you acquainted with the organization knownas the League of American Writers ?
Mr. JEROME. I decline to answer the question, invoking the privilegeunder the fifth amendment.
Mr. WALTER. And as I understand your reason, it is because thisorganization is Communist, and to admit association with it wouldincriminate you ?
Mr. JEROME. I have answered that to explain my reasons for in-voking the privilege represents a violation of the principle involved inthat privilege.
Mr. MOULDER. The question was whether he was acquainted withthat organization, is that right?
Mr. TAVENNER. That is right.
Mr. WALTER. You know it is a Communist organization, do younot ?
Mr. JEROME. I refuse to answer the question for the reason given.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you acquainted with an organization known asHollywood Writers' Mobilization?
Mr. JEROME. I refuse to answer the question on the ground of pos-sible self-incrimination.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you state whether or not you know that theHollywood Writers' Mobilization is an affiliate, or was an affiliate,of the League of American Writers?
Mr. JEROME. I refuse to answer the question, claiming the privilege.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you familiar with the magazine Clipper?
Mr. JEROME. I refuse to answer the question, claiming the privilege.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Jerome, were you familiar with the Schoolfor Writers which was operated in Hollywood, Calif., first by theHollywood chapter of the League of American Writers, and laterby the Hollywood Writers' Mobilization?
Mr. JEROME. I refuse to answer the question, claiming the privilegeunder the Constitution against self-incrimination.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you acquainted with the People's EducationalCenter as an organization?
Mr. JEROME. I refuse to answer the question on the grounds of possible self-incrimination.60COMMUNISM IN THE MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you state, if you know, whether or not theHollywood branch of the People's Educational Center took over theoffices of the School for Writers?
Mr. JEROME. I have no knowledge of any such fact?
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you discuss with the officers of the HollywoodWriters' Mobilization the turning over of its facilities to the People'sEducational Center?
Mr. JEROME. I have no knowledge of any such fact.
Mr. MOTULDER. Do you have any knowledge concerning the activitiesof any of the organizations mentioned by counsel?
Mr. JEROME. I refuse to answer the question on the grounds given.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Jerome, in the business of solicitation on commission which you stated you had been engaged in, was that businesscarried on in any manner in connection with any of these publications which I have asked you about, or any of these organizationswhich I have asked you about ?
Mr. JEROME.- To the best of my recollection, no. In fact, I rememberno such connection.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was the type of your connection with thesepublications which I have mentioned?
Mr. JEROME. I refuse to answer the question, invoking the privilegeagainst self-incrimination.
Mr. KEARNEY. For whom did you solicit printing ?
Mr. JEROME. I refuse to answer the question, since it might entailthe possibility of self-incrimination.
Mr. DOYLE. May I ask a question, Mr. Chairman ?
Mr. WOOD. Mr. Doyle.
Mr. DOYLE. Are you a member of the Elks' Club ?
Mr. JEROME. No, sir.
Mr. DOYLE. Are you a member of the B'nai B'rith Lodge?
Mr. JEROME. NO, sir.
Mr. DOYE. Are you a member of any of the Masonic fraternities?
Mr. JEROME. NO, sir.
Mr. DOYLE. Are you a member of any of the lodges identified withany religious organization in this country?
Mr. JEROME. No, sir.
Mr. DOYLE. If so, what ones?
Mr. JEROME. No lodge of any religious organization.
Mr. DOYLE. Are you a member of any of the established automobileclubs in this country, such as the AAA !
Mr. JEROME. No, sir.
Mr. DOYLE. Are you a member of any lodge having its headquartersin the city of New York?
Mr. JEROME. I would like to understand the meaning of the word"lodge," sir.
Mr. DOYLE. A lodge as generally accepted.
Mr. JEROME. As a fraternal organization?
Mr. DOYLE. Yes.
Mr. JEROME. I refuse to answer the question on the grounds of possible self-inerimination.
Mr. DOYLE. You have just answered that you were not a member ofthe other lodges identified.
Mr. JEROME. That is right.COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY61
Mr. DOYLE. Are you a member of any organization or group thatmight be termed ordinarily, and is ordinarily termed, as a secretorganization, in our country?
Mr. JEROME. I would like further clarification on this question, because to me I would have to have the definition of the word "secret."It may be secret to X and not to Y and maybe to Z. Therefore, it ishard for me to know what the intent of your question is.
Mr. DOYLE. Any organization that is secret to you, in your esteem,your judgment?
Mr. JEROME. No, sir.
Mr. KEARNEY. Mr. Chairman.
Mr. WooD. General Kearney.
Mr. KEARNEY. Are you a member of any organization that has forits aims or objectives the overthrow of this Government by forceor violence?
Mr. JEROME. No, sir.
Mr. KEARNEY. Are you a member of the Communist Party?
Mr.. JEROME. I refuse to answer the question on the grounds ofpossible self-incrimination.
Mr. WIOOD. I understood in the early part of your testimony that atthe time you were engaged in printing solicitation-was that around1930?
Mr. JEROME. Around that period.
Mr. WOOD. That has been 20 years ago ?
Mr. JEROME. Yes; 1929 or 1930.
Mr. WOOD. You understand, of course, that the statute of limita-tions protects you after the expiration of 3 years for any activity youmay have engaged in that may be termed illegal.
Mr. JEROME. I still stand on the claiming of the privilege.
Mr. WOOD. With reference to the question counsel asked you aboutthe Hollywood Writers' Mobilization, have you ever made any literarycontribution of any character that could in any sense be termedsubversive or anti-American to that periodical?
Mr. JEROME. What is the name of the periodical, please?
Mr. WOOD. Hollywood Writers' Mobilization.
Mr. JEROME. I have never written for that publication.
Mr. WOOD. At all?
Mr. JEROME. At all.
Mr. WooD. Well, then, why did you refuse to answer counsel's ques-tion when he interrogated you about your connection with the Hollywood Writers' Mobilization? Have you ever had any financial connection with it in any way ?
Mr. JEROME. I have never had any connections with that organization.
Mr. WOOD. At all?
Mr. JEROME. At all.
Mr. WooD. Well, then, your statement a while ago when you refusedto answer counsel's question as to that organization on the ground ofself-incrimination was erroneous, wasn't it? It wouldn't incriminateyou, would it?
Mr. JEROME. The choice of that privilege is not an admission ofincrimination.
Mr. WooD. Do you mean to say you can invoke the protection of thefifth amendment and refuse to answer a question as to an organiza-62COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRYtion, the answer to which would be that you had no connection withit at all?
Mr. JEROME. When in my discretion it may lead into an area inwhich self-incrimination is possible.
Mr. WOOD. I am glad we are getting ourselves identified. Then youtake the position you can refuse to answer any question you wish byhiding behind the fifth amendment?
Mr. JEROME. No.
Mr. WOOD. What do you mean ?
Mr. JEROME. The fifth amendment is there to protect me againstacting as a witness against myself, and when in my discretion I feelthat answering a question put to me represents acting as a witnessagainst myself and involves the question of self-incrimination I invokethat right.
Mr. WooD. You have invoked that right here today on a matter thatcannot incriminate you, and you have just admitted it, haven't you?
Mr. JEROME. I have admitted what.
Mr. WOOD. As to Hollywood Writers' Mobilization.
Mr. JEROME. IS that the name of a publication or an organization?
Mr. WooD. This group has a publication.
Mr. JEROME. I said I have never written for that publication andI have no connection with it.
Mr. WOOD. What is the name of the publication?
Mr. JEROME. I don't know, sir. I go by the name you mentioned tome and asked if I wrote for it.
Mr. WOOD. How about the Hollywood Quarterly
Mr. JEROME. What is that? Is that connected with that organization ?
Mr. WOOD. Yes.
Mr. JEROME. That is a new question to me ?
Mr. WOOD. Yes.
Mr. JEROME. What is the question ?
Mr. WOOD. Are you familiar with that publication, HollywoodQuarterly?
Mr. JEROME. By "familiar" you mean have I ever seen it or read it?
Mr. WOOD. Yes.
Mr. JEROME. I have seen it.
Mr. WooD. Have you ever made any literary contribution to it?
Mr. JEROME. To that quarterly?
Mr. WOOD. Yes.
Mr. JEROME. No, sir.
Mr. POTTER. Mr. Jerome, in answer to Mr. Kearney's question, yousaid you do not belong to any organization which believes in the overthrow of our Government by force and violence. If the United Statesshould become involved in a war with Russia, would you support theUnited States or Russia ?
Mr. JEROME. I wish to answer that I consider this question no basisfor any reply that I can make in the interests of truth and reality. Ibelieve there is no basis in reality for that question. I think it is asuppositious, hypothetical, and provocative question that could onlyserve to romote war.
Mr. KEARNEY. Would it take you, as an American, to go into a longspeech on a question like that?COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY63
Mr. JEROME. It would if the interests of the American people wouldnot be served by breaking down all possibilities of establishing a relationship of amity between countries, and driving the mentality of ourcountry into a war situation by that type of questions.
Mr. POTTER. So you refuse to answer the question ?
Mr. JEROME. I do not refuse to answer the question. My answer tothe question is, I am interested in helping bring about peaceful relationships between those countries and all countries.
Mr. POTTER. That does not answer the question, so you refuse toanswer the question ?
Mr. JEROME. I do not wish to be a party to answering a question thatwill just heighten a so-called war spirit in this country. I feel atthis time, when a meeting is taking place to bring the Four Powerstogether, the hysteria raised by such a question cannot serve the goodinterests of the country.
Mr. WOOD. Don't you think you are in rather poor position today,in view of the answers you have given to questions of counsel andmembers of the committee, to take the position you take now ?
Mr. JEROME. I do not. I believe the position I take is joined bymost of the people of the country. I think they want peace and notwar.
Mr. POTTER. None of us want war. If our security was at stake,would you support the United States or would you support SovietRussia? You have refused to answer the question.
Mr. KEARNEY. Mr. Chairman.
Mr. WooD. General Kearney.
Mr. KEARNEY. There is a proposed "peace" march on Washington, Ibelieve March 15. Are you connected with that movement ?
Mr. JEROME. No, sir.
Mr. VELDE. Mr. Chaiman.
Mr. WooD. Mr. Velde.
Mr. VELDE. You do agree that this is a legally constituted committeeof the Congress, do you not ?
Mr. JEROME. I do, sir.
Mr. VELDE. Do you agree that we are attempting to determine whatsubversive forces exist in this country ?
Mr. JEROME. I do, sir.
Mr. VELDE. Do you refuse to cooperate by answering questions asto those subversive forces ?
Mr. JEROME. My position is to cooperate as best I can. I believe,however, I am entitled to invoke a constitutional privilege granted meagainst self-incrimination.
Mr. VELDE. Then you refuse to answer any questions pertaining toany organizations that you belong to that you might think are subversive or incriminating?
Mr. JEROME. I refuse to answer any question that in my opinionwould put me in a position of possibly incriminating myself, and inlthis I believe I am constitutionally protected.
Mr. WooD. What I can't understand about your testimony, Mr.Jerome-and I am not trying to embarrass you.
Mr. JEROME. I understand.
Mr. WOOD. You admit you are a writer. From that we are to assumethat you have written material for public consumption. Yet you64COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRYdecline to tell us to what publications you have made such literary contributions. What is your objection to giving the committee the benefitof that information ? How can that possibly incriminate you ?
Mr. JEROME. I can only repeat my answer to a similar question be-fore, that I must exercise my discretion in understanding the applicability of the privilege to the situation and the specific question putto me.
Mr. WooD. Of course we are going to have to accept that answer,or that declination to answer the question, but I think you must realize it places the committee in a very peculiar position of not being ableto understand what is in your mind in declining to answer it. As tomost of the questions, you would be protected under the statute oflimitations, anyhow.
Mr. DOYLE. May I ask a question, Mr. Chairman?
Mr. WooD. Mr. Doyle.
Mr. DOYLE. I believe you said, "I have been a writer, an editor.fact, it was my main occupation."InDo you remember that?
Mr. JEROME. Yes.
Mr. DOYLE. In answer to Mr. Potter's question, or Mr. Velde's ques-tion, you said you believe this is a legally constituted committee ofCongress. You said that ?
Mr. JEROME. Yes.SMr. DOYLE. As one group of Americans talking to another American-even if you are naturalized--don't you think it is within theprovince of the representatives of the American people to go into thequestion of the main occupation of people as American citizens ? Youtestified that was your main occupation-writing?
Mr. JEROME. Yes.
Mr. DOYLE. Wherein, then, are we in error in asking you what youdid during the time you were in your main occupationIf so, whereare we in error ? How could it incriminate you to frankly and honestlytell us how you engaged yourself in your main occupation, whichyou have told us was writing? I am not assuming, in asking you thatquestion, that you have been violating any law. I assume you have inall your writings been a patriotic American writer. But you do raisea question in my mind, if you refuse to tell us as one American toanother American group, you cause a doubt in my mind as to whetheror not you have told us the truth about what your main occupation was.Are you ashamed of it or is it because you have been in violation of lawor committed some public wrong or what ? Have you been associatedwith men and women who have been trying to overthrow our Government in their writings, have they been paying you, or what? I don'tunderstand.
Mr. JEROME. Let me answer this way: Of course, this committeeis entitled to pursue its questioning in terms of its best understandingof how to carry through its set task of this morning or any otheroccasion.But this committee certainly also realizes that it does thiswithin the framework of certain constitutional guarantees that areopen to Americans, and which we have a right to claim on certainbases. When I claim them I am not setting myself outside the rangeof Americanism, but I am exercising a right afforded me by theAmerican Constitution.
Mr. WALTER. That goes to the possibility of being prosecuted crimi-nally. If the statute of limitations has run, what possible dangerCOMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY65could you be in that would entitle you to invoke the provisions of theConstitution as a protection ?
Mr. JEROME. I do not feel called upon to go into an explanation ofmy understanding of invoking the privilege.
Mr. WALTER. I was trying to refresh you on fundamental principles,that is all.
Mr. VELDE. If it should happen that later you were cited for con-tempt of Congress, would you still agree that this is a legally constituted committee of Congress ?
Mr. JEROME. I would like to consult counsel on that.
Mr. WOOD. You have the privilege of conferring with your counselat any time you desire.(Witness confers with his counsel.)
Mr. POWE. Mr. Chairman, I have advised my client that in the lightof the last answer-
Mr. WooD. The rule of the committee is that you can advise yourclient and let your client give the answer.
Mr. POWE. I thought the committee would like to know the reasonwhy I advised him.
Mr. WOOD. We are not concerned with that. You advise him andlet him answer.
Mr. JEROME. Upon advice of my counsel I answer that question thatan answer to this question involves legal opinion which I am notqualified at this time to answer, but if such a situation should ariseas was here indicated as a possibility, I would then act upon theadvice of counsel.
Mr. VELDE. But your answer to my question originally that youagreed that this was a legally constituted committee of Congress-
Mr. JEROME. That is right.
Mr. VELDE (continuing). Was also on the advice of counsel?
Mr. JEROME. No. This is my understanding, and I believe it wouldbe the advice of counsel if I consulted him.
Mr. DOYLE. I think the record should show that counsel was presentat all times with the witness in all these questions and counsel made noobjection.
Mr. WOOD. Well, counsel is not supposed to make objections.Proceed.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Jerome, did you assist in any manner in theformation of the Hollywood Writers' Mobilization?
Mr. JEROME. I refuse to answer the question on the grounds of possi-ble self-incrimination.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you acquainted with Gordon Kahn, who was amember of the editorial board of the publication Clipper, and whowas a member of the faculty of the School of Writers, now knownas the Hollywood Branch of People's Educational Center?
Mr. JEROME. I decline to answer the question, claiming the privilege.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you acquainted with Sam Moore, who, accord-ing to the August 1, 1944, issue of the Screen Writers' Guild Bulletinwas chairman of the subcommittee on radio of the Hollywood Writers'Mobilization ?
Mr. JEROME. I decline to answer the question on the grounds ofpossible self-incrimination.66COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY
Mr. TAVENNER. Another individual attached to the publicationClipper was Waldo Salt, S-a-l-t, an associate editor. Do you know
Mr. Salt?
Mr. JEROME. I decline to answer the question on the grounds ofpossible self-incrimination.

C.PUBLIC HEARINGThe Committee on Un-American Activities met pursuant to call at10: 35 a. m. in room 226, Old House Office Building, Hon. John S.Wood (chairman) presiding.Committee members present: Representatives John S. Wood (chairman), Francis E. Walter, Clyde Doyle, James B.

Mr. WooD. Let the record disclose that there are present Messrs.Walter, Doyle, Velde, Kearney, Jackson, Potter, and Wood, constituting a quorum.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Chairman, may I make a brief statement regarding the general purpose of the hearing?
Mr. WOOD. Yes, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. As is well known, the Committee on Un-AmericanActivities has succeeded to a marked degree in exposing Communists'infiltration into labor organizations, with the result in many instancesthat the organizations involved have rid themselves of Communistdomination and influences, and likewise with the result'that the Congress has been informed of many important facts as the basis forlegislative action.I need only remind you that the testimony of Matthew Cvetic virtually destroyed for the time being at least the power and influenceof the Communist Party in western Pennsylvania.Then there have been many witnesses who have frankly and openlytold this committee of the circumstances under which they were dupedinto joining the Communist Party, the Communist Party activitiesobserved by them while they were members, and the reasons for theirbreaking with the party. This has required courage on the part ofthese witnesses. But, in so testifying, they have performed a serviceof inestimable value to their country and in the end should and doreceive the plaudits of their fellow citizens.78COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRYThe hearing today is the first of a series designed by the committeeto accomplish the same results in the entertainment field as have beenaccomplished in labor and other fields. In performing its statutoryduty to investigate communism wherever it may be found, we shallendeavor to ascertain the extent of past and present Communistinfiltration in the field mentioned.It is hoped that any witness appearing during the course of thesehearings, who made the mistake of associating himself or herself withthe Communist Party, will have sufficient courage and loyalty tomake an honest and complete disclosure of all they know about Communist Party activities.These hearings, Mr. Chairman, have not been hastily conceived.They are based upon investigative efforts by staff members extendingover a number of years. As you will recall, it was contemplated thatthese hearings be conducted in Hollywood by the subcommittee whichwas chosen to conduct the hearings in Hawaii; but, in view of thework required of the staff in the preparation of the Hawaiian hearings and other hearings, this matter was postponed.Now, Mr. Chairman, I would like to call, as the first witness, Mr.Larry Parks.
Mr. WOOD. Is Mr. Parks present ?
Mr. PARKS. Yes.
Mr. WOOD. Will you stand, please?Do you solemnly swear theevidence you give this committee shall be the truth, the whole truthand nothing but the truth, so help you God ?
Mr. PARKS. I do.
Mr. WOOD. Have a seat.TESTIMONY OF LARRY PARKS, ACCOMPANIED BY HIS COUNSEL,LOUIS MANDEL
Mr. TAVEN NER. Will you please state your full name, Mr. Parks ?
Mr. PARKS. Larry Parks.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you represented by counsel?
Mr. PARKS. Yes, I am. My counsel is Mr. Mandel.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will counsel identify himself ?
Mr. MANDEL. Louis Mandel, 1501 Broadway, New York City.In the light of the testimony that Mr. Parks will give here, he hasprepared a statement that he would like to read at this point. I thinkit is a proper background to the testimony he will give and be veryenlightening to the committee as his testimony unfolds. May he readthat statement ?
Mr. WOOD. Is it your purpose, Mr. Tavenner, to ask the witnessquestions ?
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes, sir.
Mr. WooD. At the conclusion of his testimony, if he desires to readthe statement that has been presented to the members here, he willbe given that privilege, or he can put it in the record, as he desires,after he has finished his testimony.'
Mr. MANDEL. The only reason I asked for it at this point is becauseI think in light of the testimony it won't have the same effect after asit will when you connect it with the testimony. And I think there is1See appendix at end of hearings printed under this title.COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREno harm;INiDUSTRY79There is nothing in the statement that can't be connectedwith the testimony. There is nothing there except the simple statement of facts. And I would, in fairness to the witness, urge verystrongly that he be permitted, because there is a connecting link towhat he will testify here in this statement, because it is with thatspirit that he will testify.And I think, in proper consideration of the witness and what he willdo, this opportunity ought to be given to him, and I urge it verystrongly if the committee will consider it.
Mr. WOOD. Proceed, Mr. Tavenner.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Parks, when and where were you born?
Mr. PARKS. I was born on a farm in Kansas. I suppose the legaltown would be Olathe. That was the closest town.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you relate briefly to the committee the detailsregarding your educational background ?
Mr. PARKS. Well, I was born in Kansas on a farm. I moved whenI was quite small to Illinois. I attended the high school in Joliet, Ill.,and I also attended and graduated from the University of Illinois,where I majored in chemistry and minored in physics. I sometimeswonder how I got in my present line of work.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was the date of the completion of your workat the university?
Mr. PARKS. 1936.
Mr. TAVENNER. Now, what is your present occupation?
Mr. PARKS. Actor.
Mr. TAVENNER. What is your present address ?
Mr. PARKs. 1737 Nichols Canyon, Hollywood, Calif.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Parks, I believe you were present when I madea statement as to the purpose of this series of hearings.
Mr. PARKS. Yes; I was present, and I heard you.
Mr. TAVENNER. Then you understand that we desire to learn thetrue extent, past and present, of Communist infiltration into thetheater field in Hollywood, and the committee asks your cooperationin developing such information. There has been considerable testimony taken before this committee regarding a number of organizations in Hollywood, such as the Actors' Laboratory; Actors' Laboratory Theater; Associated Film Audiences-Hollywood Branch; Citizens' Committee for Motion-Picture Strikers; Film Audiences for Democracy or Associated Film Audiences; Hollywood Anti-Nazi Leagueor Hollywood League Against Nazism; Hollywood Independent Citizens' Committee of the Arts, Sciences, and Professions; HollywoodLeague for Democratic Action; Hollywood Motion-Picture Democratic Committee; Hollywood Peace Forum; Hollywood Theater Alliance; Hollywood Writers' Mobilization; Motion Picture Artists'Committee; People's Educational Center, Los Angeles; Mooney Defense Committee-Hollywood Unit; Progressive Citizens of America;Hollywood Committee of the Arts, Sciences, and Professions; Councilof the PCA; Southern California Chapter of the PCA; WorkersSchool of Los Angeles.Have you been connected or affiliated in any way with any of thoseorganizations?
Mr. PARKS. I have.80COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you state the names of those organizationswhich you have been affiliated with ? To aid you, I will hand you thelist from which I read, some of which I may not have read, most ofwhich I did.
Mr. PARKS (looking at sheet of paper containing list). Well, mostof them I'm not familiar with. I'm familiar with the Actors' Laboratory. It has it divided into two categories here. I'm familiar withthe Actors' Lab. I believe these two should be just one.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, did you hold any official position in thatorganization ?
Mr. PARKS. For a time I was sort of honorary treasurer of thisorganization.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was that in 1949 and 1950 or when was that ?
Mr. PARKS. Well, I can't recall the exact date. I don't believe itwas in 1950.date.I believe it was before that.I can't tell you the exact
Mr. TAvENNER. Will you proceed?
Mr. PARKS. Perhaps you could help me on this. The HollywoodIndependent Citizens' Committee of the Arts, Sciences and Professions, does this or did this have any other name attached to it beforeor after?
Mr. TAVENNER. Just a moment. We are looking it up in our refer-ence books.There has been a finding that this organization grew out of theIndependent Voters Committee of the Arts and Sciences. Does thathelp you ?
Mr. PARKS. Well, no. This is my problem: Most of these thingsI'm not familiar with. Some of them I recognize the names. And Ibelieve that I for a time was a member of the Hollywood IndependentCitizens Committee of the Arts, Sciences and Professions.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you state again what it was that you were amember of ?
Mr. PARKS. I say I am of the opinion-perhaps you could help meon this-that I was a member of the Hollywood Independent Citizens'Committee of the Arts, Sciences and Professions.
Mr. WooD. We will have to ask the photographers to not blockthe view.
Mr. PARKS (continuing). Perhaps if you would like to ask me anyquestions about it, I'd be happy to answer you. I think maybe it wouldexpedite matters if you would do that.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, do you recall whether or not the ProgressiveCitizens of America was the outgrowth or successor to the HollywoodDemocratic Committee or what was known as the Hollywood Demo#cratic Committee? Does that assist you?
Mr. PARKS. I am of that opinion.I am of that opinion.I believethat's true. I think that was why I asked you the question in thefirst place. I didn't remember the name. I think that's true.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you a member of it
Mr. PARKS. Yes; I was.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you hold any official position in the organi-zation ?
Mr. PARKS. No; I don't believe so. Not that I recall.
Mr. TAVENNER. What other organizations listed there were youaffiliated with ?COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY81
Mr. PARKS. What do you mean "affiliated with"?
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, in which you have become a member or thatyou were active in support of, either by way of membership or byway of aid and support, by contribution or by work.
Mr. PARKS. Well, I don'tMr. TAVENNER. And if you aided in any way by entertainment, thatI think would constitute affiliation or connection with the organization.
Mr. PARKS. Well, that's all. Those two are the only ones that I canthink of at the moment. Perhaps if you could refresh my memoryI would appreciate it.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, were you affiliated with the Civil Rights Con-gress in any manner ?
Mr. PARKS. No; I don't believe so. I don't recall being affiliatedwith that at this time.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, did you appear at any meeting of that organi-zation to your knowledge?
Mr. PARKs. It's quite possible that I did.
Mr. TAVENNER. According to the Evening Star, of Washington,D. C., of the issue of November 3, 1947, you are reported to have beenone of the speakers
Mr. PARKS. As I say, it's quite possible at that particular time.
Mr. TAVENNER (continuing). At a reception given Gerhart Eisler.Do you recall that ?
Mr. PARKS. No; I don't recall ever being at a reception for GerhartEisler. To the best of my knowledge I never met the man. I havenever seen him. When I was in Washington last time I attendedmany meetings and many receptions. I'm not familiar with the namesof these. If you ask me if I was at this reception, it's quite possiblethat I was. What the name of it is I can't recall at this time, and Iprobably didn't know at that time.
Mr. TAVENNER. Now, referring back to the Actors' Laboratory ofwhich you were an officer, you were the treasurer I believe? Is thatnot true?
Mr. PARKS. In name I was treasurer; yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. What do you mean by stating that you were treasurer "in name"?
Mr. PARKS. Well, this was more of an honorary position than anactive one. Usually you think of a man that is treasurer having todo only with money. My job as the treasurer was to sign a batch ofchecks at a time, and that's the extent of my knowledge of the moneymatters of the lab.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you tell the committee whether or not in yourexperience in Hollywood and as a member of these organizations towhich you have testified there were to your knowledge Communists inthese various organizations which I have referred to, particularlythose that you were a member of?
Mr. PARKS. I think that I can say "Yes" to that.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, who were these Communists?
Mr. PARKS. There were people in the Actors' Lab, for instance-this, in my opinion, was not a Communist organization in any sense ofthe word. As in any organization, it has all colors of political philosophy. And there were in these I suppose-I know nothing about whobelonged other than myself to the Independent Citizens Committee of82COMMUNISMINMOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRYthe Arts, Sciences, and Professions. This I won't say because I don'tknow. There were Communists attached to the lab.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, were there Communists attached to theseother organizations which you say you were a member of ?
Mr. PARKS. This I'm not familiar with.I don't know.know who else was a member of them besides myself.I don't
Mr. TAVENNER. Your answer is because you do not recall who weremembers of those other organizations?
Mr. PARKs. I think that that is the gist of my answer; yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. But you do recall that .at the Actors' Laboratorythere were members of the Communist Party ?
Mr. PARKS. That's true.
Mr. TAVENNER. Dia those Communist Party members endeavor toobtain control of the activities of the organization and of its variousoffices?
Mr. PARKS. No; I would not say that this was true at all. The labwas a school for acting and was also sort of a showcase for actors.I left the lab because I disagreed with the purpose.of forming a permanent repertory theater.I was in favorIt was felt by the majorityof the lab that they wanted it the way it was, as a school. I wasn'tinterested in the school. They wanted it as a showcase. I didn't wantit as a showcase.I wanted a permanent repertory theater for a smallgroup of professional actors, and it was on this basis that I left theActors' Lab.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, what was your opportunity to know and toobserve the fact that there were Communists in that organization?
Mr. PARKS. I knew them as Communists.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, what had been your opportunity to know themas Communists.
Mr.
Mr.
Mr.
Mr.PARKS. May I answer this fully and in my own way?TAVENNER. I would like for you to.PARKS. All right.TAVENNER. I hope you will.
Mr. PARKS. I am not a Communist.I would like to point out thatin my opinion there is a great difference between-and not a subtledifference--between being a Communist, a member of the Commu-nist Party, say in 1941, 10 years ago, and being a Communist in 1951.To my mind this is a great difference and not a subtle one.It is also, I feel, not a subtle difference to be a member of the Communist Party and being a Communist. I do not believe in my ownmind that this is a subtle difference either.I would furnish you with-I guess you would call it an allegory asto what I mean so that you will see why I say it is not a subtle difference.The President of this country is a Democrat. He is the head ofthe Democratic Party. They have a platform, certain aims. Thereare many people who call themselves Democrats. There are certainsouthern Democrats, for instance, that do not follow the aims andplatform of the Democratic Party as we call it, yet they are calledDemocrats. Well, in fact, they in my opinion are Republicans really;at least, this is the way they work.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, now, that could be said and a similar analysiscould be given of the Progressive Party or any other party, but letUSCOMMUNISMIN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY83
Mr. PARKS. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER (continuing). Confine ourselves to the question ofcommunismMr. PARKS. Yes.Well, I'm drawing an allegory.
Mr. TAVENNER (continuing). Rather than speaking in terms of allegory.
Mr. PARKS. Well, I felt that it was necessary so that you couldsee that this is not a subtle difference, you see.
Mr. TAVENNER. NO; I think the committee can understand byspeaking plainlyMr. PARKS. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER (continuing). And to the pointMr. PARKS. I'm trying to.
Mr. TAVENNER (continuing). On communism.
Mr. PARKS. I'm trying to. As I say, I am not a Communist. Iwas a member of the Communist Party when I was a much youngerman, 10 years ago. I was a member of the Communist Party.
Mr. TAVENNER. I wish you would tell the committee the circumstances under which you became a member of the Communist Party;that is, when and where and, if you left the Communist Party as youhave indicated, when you did it and why you did it.
Mr. PARKS. Well, I will do this if I may. I missed one point thatI mentioned-that there is also a difference I feel in being a memberof the Communist Party in 1941 and being a Communist in 1951.In 1941-all right?
Mr. TAVENNER. Go ahead.
Mr. PARKS (continuing). Being a member of the Communist Partyfulfilled certain needs of a young man that was liberal in thought,idealistic, who was for the underprivileged, the underdog. I feltthat it fulfilled these particular needs. I think that being a Communist in 1951 in this particular situation is an entirely differentkettle of fish when this is a great power that is trying to take over theworld. This is the difference.I became a CommunistMr. TAVENNER. Now, just a moment. In other words, you didn'trealize that the purpose and object of the Communist Party was totake over other segments of the world in 1941, but you do realize thatthat is true in 1951? Is that the point you are making?
Mr. PARKS. Well, I would like to say this: That this is in no wayan apology for anything that I have done, you see, because I feelI have done nothing wrong ever. Question of judgment? This isdebatable. I feel that as far as I am concerned that in 1941, asfar as I knew it, the purposes as I knew them fulfilled simply-atleast I thought they would fulfill as I said before-certain idealism,certain being for the underdog, which I am today this very minute.This did not work out particularly this way. I wasn't particularly interested in it after I did become a member. I attended veryfew meetings, and I drifted away from it the same way that-Ipetered out the same way I drifted into it. To the best of my recollection, as I recall-the dates are not exact because at that particular time it wasn't an important step one way or the other; I feelas I say that the dates are approximate-it was in 1941, and to thebest of my recollection I petered out about the latter part of 1944or 1945.81595-51-pt. 1-384COLMUNISMINMOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY
Mr. TAVENNER. Now, we are not making here a distinction between the Communist Party and the Communist Political Association, but, as a result of investigation that the committee has doneand information that it has, you apparently were registered for theyear 1944 and 1945 as a member of the party. Is that in accordancewith your recollection?
Mr. PARKS. Well, as I say, I am trying to recall it for you to the bestof my ability, and I must say again that at that particular time it wasnot quite as important as it is today, and to the best of my recollectionI became a member in 1941, and to the best of my recollection it waseither in the latter part of 1944 or the early part of 1945Mr. TAVENNER. Let me see if this information in the committee fileswould be of any value in refreshing your recollections: That yourCommunist registration card for the year 1944 bore the number 46:954and for the year 1945 the number 47344. Does that happen to refreshyour recollection?
Mr. PARKS. No, sir; it doesn't, because to the best of my recollectionI never had a Communist Party card.
Mr. TAVENNER. Now, do I infer properly from your statement thatshortly after 1945 or, s-ay, in 1946 you became disillusioned about theCommunist Party and withdrew as a member ?
Mr. PARKS. Well, let's go back.recollection it was in 1944 or 1945.As I said before, to the best of myThis is to the best of my recollection.
Mr. TAVENNER. But by 1946 at least you had definitely broken withthe party ?
Mr. PARKS. I'm quite sure that that is correct.
Mr. TAVENNER. Have you participated in any Communist Partyactivities since that date, 1946?
Mr. PARKS. Not to my knowledge.I don't recall ever having par-ticipated in a Communist Party activity since that time.
Mr. TAVENNER. Now, will you state to the committee where you firstbecame a member of the party ?
Mr. PARKS. In Hollywood, Calif.
Mr. TAVENNER. Who recruited you into the party ?
Mr. PARKS. Well, a man by the name of Davidson, I believe.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was Davidson's first name and what was hisposition?
Mr. PARKS. I can't tell you this because I really don't know.I don'tremember his first name. I haven't seen him for 10 years, and I do notknow what his position was.
Mr. TAVENNER. Where did he live ? Do you know ?
Mr. PARKS. This I have no idea.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was his occupation ?
Mr. PARKS. This I do not know either.
Mr. TAVENNER. Can you give us some descriptive data of themdividual ?M1. PARKS. Average-looking man, young, dark hair.
Mr. TAVENNER. How did you become acquainted with him and inwhose presence did you see him ?
Mr. PARKS. It's pretty hard for me to recall 10 years ago-something that at the time was not particularly important... I'm doingthe best I can to recall what happened for you. I don'tfirst name, and I don't believe I ever knew what he did..niember hisCOMMUNISMIN MOTION-PICTL RE INDUSTRY85
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, what were the circumstances under whichyou met?
Mr. PARKS. Well, this is hard for me to recall, too-the exact circumstances.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was it at a meeting in your home or where?
Mr. PARKS. Well, as I say, I really don't remember. I'm being ashonest as I know how. I really don't remember.
Mr. TAVENNER. I just wanted you to give the committee what infor-mation you recall about-Mr. PARKS. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER (continuing). About how you got into the Commu-nist Party.
Mr. PARKS. As I told you, I was a good deal younger than I am now,about 25, with certain liberal tendencies, idealism.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, did you seek this individual out, or did he seekyou out?
Mr. PARKS. Well, I certainly didn't seek him out. It's hard for meto say whether he sought me out.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did others counsel you in regard to your unitingwith the Communist Party before you were recruited by this individualby the name of Davidson ?
Mr. PARES. No: I did it of my own volition.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you assigned to a Communist Party cell?
Mr. PARKS. I was.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was the name of that cell, and where was itlocated ?
Mr. PARKS. Well, it had no name that I know of. It was a group ofpeople who were Communists, and I attended some meetings with them.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, now, you were a member of that particulargroup from 1941 up to possibly as late as 1945 ?
Mr. PARKS. That's correct.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you tell us what you know about the organiza-tion of the Communist Party from your own observations during thatperiod of time in Hollywood ?
Mr. PARKS. Well, I'm afraid that I was a pretty bad member by theirlights. I didn't attend too many meetings-maybe 10, 12, 15 meetings.And what I really know about the Communist Party is very little,really.If you will ask me some qeustion that you would like to know,I would be happy to answer them to the best of my ability.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you know whether or not the writers and actorsin Hollywood were members of any particular branch or group of theCommunist Party ?
Mr. PARKS. I know that certain actors were a group that met.This I do know. The other things I do not know.(Representative James B. Frazier, Jr., enters hearing room.)
Mr. WooD. Let the record show that at this point RepresentativeFrazier has joined the hearing.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was the name of the group to which the actorswere assigned ?
Mr. PARKS. They had no name that I know of.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did it have any designation of any kind
Mr. PARKS. Not that I know of.
Mr. TAVENNER. By location or by the type of work they were in?AMr. PARKS. Well, no name that I know of. The majority of theam~Ibers of this particular group were actors.86COMMUNISM INMOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, were there several groups to which the actorsbelonged depending upon the geographical location of the actor?
Mr. PARKS. I don't believe so. I wouldn't say for certain. I'm notunder that impression.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, who was the chairman of the group to whichyou were assigned?
Mr. PARKS. Well, it had no chairman that I know of, that I recall-anyone that was chairman.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, who was the secretary of the group ?
Mr. PARKS. ThisMr. TAVENNER. Or treasurer?
Mr. PARKS. This I do not recall either. I don't know if there wereany actual officers of this particular group.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, to whom did you pay your dues?
Mr. PARKS. To various members. No one in particular that I canrecall was the treasurer.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, a person who was responsible for the collection of dues would certainly be performing the duty of a treasurereven if he did not go by that name; isn't that true?
Mr. PARKS. That's very true.
Mr. TATENNER. Well, who were those persons to whom you paidyour dues?
Mr. PARKS. Well, this is hard for me to answer, too, because the fewtimes that I paid dues, as I recall, were to different people. Just whothey were I just can't answer this.
Mr. TAVENNER. You cannot recall the name of any one individualto whom you paid?
Mr. PARKS. No one individual can I recall that I paid the dues to.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, was Communist Party literature distributedto the members at any of the meetings or through any medium?
Mr. PARKS. Certain pamphlets were available if you wished to buythem.
Mr. TAVENNER. Who was the individual who had charge of thedistribution or sale of those pamphlets ?
Mr. PARKS. This I don't know either, because the pamphlets werethere and you could buy them if you wished.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, was there any secret about who was handlingthe literature of the party ?
Mr. PARKS. No secret at all.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was the total membership of this cell in whichyou were a member ?
Mr.. PARKS. Well, it's hard for me to tell you the total membership,because, as I say, I attended meetings irregularly and not many ofthem. I would say that it ranged from certain meetings that therewere as little as 5, and I think it went up to maybe, oh, possibly 10or 12.
Mr. TAVENNER. And did the personnel change considerably between 1941 and 1945, or did it consist of the same members duringall that period of time ?
Mr. PARKS. Well, I do know that, as I say, I attended rather irregularly, and at some of the meetings I would see someone that I didn'tknow, I didn't recognize, and I would never see them again. So ifthis-this is the best answer I can give you to your question. Tlrewere people whom I did not know. I did not know their names. ICOMMUNISM INMOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY87did not recognize them. And I did not see them again at any meeting.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did speakers or organizers, Communist Partyorganizers, appear before your group from time to time-people fromthe East, let us say ?
Mr. PARKS. No, I don't recall ever seeing anyone from the East,as you say, or any "big shot," if you will allow me to put it that way.I don't recall ever seeing any of those at any of these meetings.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, are you acquainted with V. J. Jerome ?
Mr. PARKS. No, I'm not; to the best of my knowledge, I have nevermet the man.
Mr. TAVENNER. Have you ever seen him in Hollywood ?
Mr. PARKS. I don't believe I have ever seen him. I certainly knowI would not recognize the man if he walked into the room.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you acquainted with Lionel Stander ?
Mr. PARKS. I have met him.
Mr. TAVENNER. Have you ever attended a Communist Party meeting with him ?
Mr. PARKS. I don't recall ever attending a Community Party meeting with this Lionel Stander.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you know whether or not or do you have personal knowledge of whether or not he is a Communist Party member,or do you have knowledge made available to you through CommunistParty sources of his membership in the Communist Party?
Mr. PARKS. No; I do not have this knowledge at all.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you acquainted with Karen Morley ?
Mr. PARKS. I am.
Mr. TAVENNER. IS she a member of the Communist Party?
Mr. PARKS. Well, Counsel, these-I would prefer not to mentionnames, if it is at all possible, of anyone. I don't think it is fair topeople to do this. I have come to you at your request. I have comeand willingly tell you about myself. I think that, if you would allowme, I would prefer not to be questioned about names. And I willtell you everything that I know about myself, because I feel I havedone nothing wrong, and I will answer any question that you wouldlike to put to me about myself. I would prefer, if you will allow me,not to mention other people's names.
Mr. WALTER. Do you take the same position with respect to theobvious leaders of the Communist movement ?
Mr. PARKS. I do, because I don't know any of the leaders of theCommunist movement.
Mr. WALTER. Of course, you do know who was active in themovement in California?
Mr. PARKS. No; I only know the names of people who attendedcertain meetings that I attended, and these were not people whowere-I know were not people who were active, big leaders of theCommunist Party. These people I did not know, and I have nevermet them.
Mr. WALTER. Who directed the meetings that you attended?
Mr. PARKS. The meetings consisted mainly, if you will rememberthe time, consisted mainly of discussions of-we were in a war thendiscussions of how the war was going, current events, problems ofactors in their work. It was more of a social, really a social occasionthan a stereotyped kind of meeting. Does that answer your question,Congressman ?CO MMUNISMINMOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY
Mr. WALTER. It's an answer.
Mr. PARKs. Hm-m ?
Mr. WALTER. It's an answer.
Mr. PARKS. Well; I would like to answer your question if you'renot satisfied with that answer.
Mr. WALTER. Somebody must have indicated a course of procedure.Somebody must have directed activity. Because you just didn't sitdown in a polite discussion group without having an objective.
Mr. PARKS. Well-
Mr. WALTER. No; what I am interested in knowing is who directedthe activities that this group were engaged in.
Mr. PARks. And I repeat again that no one to my knowledgedirected any kind of activities. You must believe me when I saythat for all intents and purposes it was more of a social occasionthan any kind of a usual meeting.
Mr. POTTER. Who would call the meetings together?
Mr. PARKS. Well, I don't really know. I can't really answer this.
Mr. POTTER. Did you have a set, scheduled meeting once everymonth or once every week, or was it upon the call of some individual?
Mr. PARKS. Well, as I recall, various individuals would call. Idon't believe that there was any setMr. POTTER. Certainly it wasn't run by mental telepathy.
Mr. PARKS. No; I didn't say that. I say certain individuals wouldcall, and to the best of my knowledge there was no set schedule ofmeetings.
Mr. POTTER. Somebody had to issue a call?
Mr. PARKS. That's correct.
Mr. POTTER. Did you ever issue a call for your cell to get together ?
Mr. PARKS. Did I?
Mr. POTTER. Yes.
Mr. PARKS. No, I didn't.
Mr. POTTER. Then, somebody would have to tell you when the meetings would take place and where they would take place; is that nottrue?
Mr. PARKS. That's correct. I would get a call from a member ofthe group and they would say, "Well, let's have a meeting tonight,tomorrow night."
Mr. KEARNEY. Were the meetings always held at the same place ?
Mr. PARKS. No; they were not.
Mr. KEARNEY. Were they held in halls or in your own homes?
Mr. PARKS. These were held at homes. As I sayMr. KEARNEY. Did you ever have any meetings at your own home?
Mr. PARKS. Never.
Mr. KEARNEY. Where were some of the meetings held ?
Mr. PARKS. If I might add as a word of explanation, that thesewere people like myself, small type people, no different than myself inany respect at all, and no different than you or I.
Mr. KEARNEY. Where were some of these meetings held ?
Mr. PARKS. As I say, these were held in various homes in Hollywood.
Mr. KEAR-KEY. Can you name some of them ?
Mr. PARKS. Well, as I asked the counsel and as I asked the committee, if you will allow this, I would prefer not to mention namesunder these circumstances: That these were people like myself who-COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY89and I feel that I-have done nothing wrong ever. I mean along thisline. I am sure none of us is perfect. Again, the question of judgmentcertainly is there, and even that is debatable. But these are peopleMr. WOOD. Just a moment. At that point, do you entertain thefeeling that these other parties that you were associated with are likewise guiltless of any wrong?
Mr. PARKS. The people at that time as I knew them-this is myopinion of them. This is my honest opinion: That these are peoplewho did nothing wrong, people like myself.
Mr. WooD. Mr. Parks, in what way do you feel it would be injurious, then, to them to divulge their identities, when you expressedthe opinion that at no time did they do wrong?
Mr. PARKS. This brings up many questions on a personal basis,
Mr. Congressman, as an actor. If you think it's easy for a man whohas-I think I have worked hard in my profession, climbed up theladder a bit. If you think it's easy for me to appear before this committee and testify, you're mistaken, because it's not easy. This is .avery difficult and arduous job for me for many reasons.One of the reasons is that as an actor my activity is dependent agreat deal on the public. To be called before this committee at yourrequest has a certain inference, a certain innuendo that you are notloyal to this country. This is not true. I am speaking for myself.This is not true. But the inference and the innuendo is there as faras the public is concerned.Also as a representative of a great industry-not as an official representative; I don't mean it that way-but as an actor of the motionpicture industry that is fairly well known, in that respect I am arepresentative of the industry. This is a great industry. At thisparticular time it is being investigated for Communist influence.
Mr. WOOD. Don't you think the public is entitled to know about it?
Mr. PARKS. 11mm?
Mr. WooD. Don't you feel the public is entitled to know about it?
Mr. PARKS. I certainly do, and I am opening myself wide open toyou to any question that you can ask me. I will answer as honestlyas I know how. And at this particular time, as I say, the industryis-it's like taking a pot shot at a wounded animal, because the industry is not in as good a shape today as it has been, economically I'mspeaking. It has been pretty tough on it. And, as I say, this is agreat industry, and I don't say this only because it has been kind tome. It has a very important job to do to entertain people, in certainrespects to call attention to certain evils, but mainly to entertain, andin this I feel that they have done a great job. Always when ourcountry has needed certain help, the industry has been in the forefrontof that help.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Chairman, may I make an observation?
Mr. WooD. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. You are placing your reluctance to testify upon thegreat job that the moving-picture industry is doing or can do?
Mr. PARKS. Excuse me, Mr. Counsel. I really hadn't finished, andthat was just part of it. If you'd let me finish, then-Is that all right?
Mr. TAVENNER. Very well.90COMMUNISMIN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY
Mr. PARKS. That's one part of it. On the question of namingnames, it is my honest opinion that the few people that I could name,these names would not be of service to the committee at all. I amsure that you know who they are. These people I feel honestly arelike myself, and I feel that I have done nothing wrong. Question ofjudgment? Yes, perhaps. And I also feel that this is not--to beasked to name names like this is not-in the way of American justiceas we know it, that we as Americans have all been brought up, that itis a bad thing to force a man to do this. I have been brought up thatway. I am sure all of you have.And it seems to me that this is not the American way of doingthings-to force a man who is under oath and who has opened himself as wide as possible to this committee-and it hasn't been easy todo this-to force a man to do this is not American justice.I perhaps later can think of more things to say when I leave, butthis is in substance I guess what I want to say.
Mr. WOOD. Well, I am glad, of course, to give considerable leewayto the range of your statement, because I for one am rather curiousto understand just what the reasons are in your mind for decliningto answer the question.
Mr. PARKS. I'm not declining. I'm asking you if you would notpress me on this.
Mr. WooD. I'm not going to press the point with you, unless othermembers of the committee wish to.
Mr. POTTER. Mr. Chairman, could I ask one question ?
Mr. WooD. Mr. Potter.
Mr. POTTER. Are any of the members that were in the particularCommunist cell that you were in to your knowledge still active members in the Communist Party ?
Mr. PARKS. I can't say this, Congressman, because I have divorcedmyself completely. I have no way of knowing this at all. I knowwhat I think inside if that would-my opinion is that 99 percent ofthem are not. This is my opinion, that they are people like myself.
Mr. POrrER. If you knew people in Hollywood that were identifiedwith the party then, would you be reluctant to cite their names if theywere active members at the present time ?
Mr. PARKS. I would be reluctant on only one score: that I do notthink that it is good for an American to be forced to do this. Only onthis score. But I feel that a man-the people that I knew-it is myopinion that they are not members of the Communist Party at thistime. This is my opinion only. If they are, they shouldn't be.
Mr. POTTER. If you had knowledge of a man who committed murder,certainly you wouldn't be hesitant to give that information to theproper authorities?
Mr. PARKS. That is correct.
Mr. POTTER. Now, I assume that you share the belief that we sharethat an active member of the Communist Party believes in principlesthat we don't believe in, in overthrowing our Government by forceand violence. Now, you say you would readily give information concerning a man you have knowledge has committed murder. Wouldn'tyou also give information to the proper authorities of a man you knewor a woman you knew or believed to be working to overthrow our Government by force and violence ?COMMUNISMIN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY91
Mr. PARKS. I will say this to you. If I knew a man that committedmurder, this is against the law of our land, and I'm not drawing afine line for my own protection when I say this. I'm not doing this atall. I'm telling you honestly what I think. This is against the lawof our land. This is a reprehensible thing to do to commit murder, andI certainly would name him immediately. The other question iseven now it is not against the law of our land, the legal law of theland. Do you understand the difference that I mean?
Mr. POTrER. So when we are drafting men to fight Communist ag-gression, you feel that it is not your duty as an American citizen togive the committee the benefit of what knowledge you might haveconcerning persons who are in the very opposite ?
Mr. PARKS. Who are what'?
Mr. POTTER. Who are in the very opposite as to what our men arefighting for ?
Mr. PARKS. Well, yes; I wanted to do that. I think that there is adifference, Congressman, in my opinion. There is a difference betweenpeople who would harm our country and people who in my opinionare like myself, who, as I feel, did nothing wrong at the time
Mr. POTTER. You don't believe a man todayMr. PARKS (continuing). And is guilty of bad judgment.
Mr. POTTER. Yes; I'm not. questioning that point when you say thatpeople like yourself and others may be misguided or because of faultyjudgment were members of the party. But you don't believe todaythat anyone can be naive enough to belong to the Communist Party,be an active member of the Communist Party, and not know what he'sdoing ?
Mr. PARKS. That is correct. That is correct. That is what I believe.
Mr. POTTER. For that reason I can't see your consistency in sayingwhy you won't name someone who you know today is an active memberof the party.
Mr. PARKS. But I do not know anyone today that is an active member of the party. This is what I said at the outset of this, Congressman.
Mr. POTTER. If you did know, you would tell?
Mr. PARKS. Yes; I think I would.
Mr. POTTER. That's all.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Parks, it seems to me that your argument insubstance is this: That this committee should investigate communismbut not find out who it is that is a Conununist.
Mr. PARKS. No, Counsel, that is not myMr. TAVENNER. In the final analysis, isn't that your argument?
Mr. PARKS. No; this is not my argument at all. Not at all.
Mr. TAVENNER. You are taking the position that in your opinionit is not important to find out who may be in communism in Hollywood
Mr. PARKs. NoMr. TAVENNER (continuing). Rather than for this committee todetermine what its obligations are under the statute which created itto investigate communism ?
Mr. PARKS. No, Counsel; I didn't say this at all.
Mr. TAVENNER. But isn't that the result of your argument?92COMMUNISMIN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY
Mr. PARKs. No, Counsel, I do not believe that this is the result ofmy argument at all. What I say to you and what I believe is that thefew people that I knew at that time are people like myself who areas loyal to this country as you or anybody else is.
Mr. T.AENNER. And if every witness who came before this com-mittee were permitted to take that position, then the extent of theinvestigation that this committee could conduct would be limitedentirely by the attitude of the witness, wouldn't it?
Mr..PA.RKS. But I told you the circumstances surrounding my smallactivity with the Communist Party, you see. And this makes quitea difference. This makes quite a difference.
Mr. TAVENNER. In your judgment?
Mr. PARKS. In my judgment, yes. Not only in my judgment. Iknow-at least inside of myself-that these people were like myself,and the most that you can accuse them of is a lack of judgment. Andeven this-Mr. TAVENNER. Now, youMr. PARKS. Even this I will say again: I say none of this in apologyfor what I did, because a young man at 25, if he's not a liberal, if heis not full of idealism, is not worth his salt. And if you make a mistake in judgment like this, I don't particularly, myself, believe thatit is serious. If you arrive at certain conclusions after thisMr. TAVENNER. Yes; but if every-witness who took the stand beforethis committee would be the final judge of when a thing was seriousand when it was not, and the committee would be limited accordingly,how could this committee carry out its statutory duty ?
Mr. PARKS. But I'm asking you as a man, having told you andopened myself to you, thatMr. TAVENNER. And I'm only asking that you see the other sideof it.
Mr. PARKS. I do see the other side.
Mr. TAVENNER. Now you have placed Hollywood on a very highpedestal here.
Mr. PARKS. I have.
Mr. TAVENNER. But there has been testimony here involving thescientific professions, persons in Government, persons in numerous industries, and I take it that there is no distinction or no preference ofany kind that should be allowed to your profession over that of thescientific professions or any other calling in life.
Mr. PARKS. That is true. But I have told you and, as I say, openedmyself as wide as I know how to you and told you the extent of myactivities as a member at one time of the Communist Party as a youngman. What little I know, as you can judge for yourself-as I toldyou, and it's the truth-I was probably the poorest member of theCommunist Party that has existed. And the few people that I knew,you probably know their names. I can see no way that this wouldbe of additional help to this committee. And, Counsel, I am surethat you realize that if this was really consequential, I would do it.But you must realize the position.
Mr. TAVENNER. Pardon me.
Mr. PARKS. I say you must realize that, as inconsequential as I wasin it. the few people that I knew, that it is very distasteful to me tobe forced into that position.COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY93
Mr. TAVENNER. I recognize that. There certainly can be no difference in opinion about that. It is a distasteful position to be in.
Mr. PARKS. And I
Mr. TAVENNER. And you have avowed here that because of the dif-ference in the situation with regard to the party now from what itwas in 1941 you have withdrawn because you now understand thepurposes of this organization which you joined years ago. Now, ifyou would be equally frank with regard to other people who are ccnnected with this organization, then this committee would be permittedto function in line with its organization, with the statutory duty thatrests upon it.And, therefore, I am going to ask you who it was who acted assecretary of this group. You expressed some doubt about it a whileago. But do you now know who was the secretary ?
Mr. PARKS. And I can honestly say to you that I do not know, tothe best of my remembrance, and I am as honest as I know how. Ido not know.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you know Elizabeth Leech ?
Mr. PARKS. I do not believe I know Elizabeth Leech. I don't recallever meeting an Elizabeth Leech.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you know a person by the name of ElizabethGlenn?
Mr. PARKS. No; to the best of my knowledge I do not know anyperson by that name.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you know a person by the name of MarjoriePotts?
Mr. PARKS. To the best of my knowledge I do not know anyoneby the name of Marjorie Potts. I don't recall ever meeting thesepeople.
Mr. TAVENNER. Now, do you know Karen Morley?
Mr. PARKS. I do.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was Karen Morley a member of this group withyou?
Mr. PARKS. And I ask you again, Counsel, to reconsider forcingme to name names under the circumstances, when I told you thatI was a member only for a short time and at that particular timein my opinion the people I knew were like myself. And I ask youagain to reconsider and not to force me into this position. I don'tthink that under the circumstances this is really American justiceto. force me to do this under these circumstances, when I have cometo you 3,000 miles and opened myself as I have.
Mr. WALTER. Mr. Chairman, may I ask counsel a question? Howcan it be material to the purpose of this inquiry to have the namesof people when we already know them? Aren't we actually, by insisting th-it this man testify as to names, overlooking the fact thatwe want to know what the organization did, what it hoped to accomplish, how it actually had or attempted to influence the thinking ofthe American people through the arts? So why is it so essential thatwe know the names of all of the people when we have a witness whomay make a contribution to what we are trying to learn ?
Mr. PARKs. May I answer your question?
Mr. WALTER. No; I am directing my question to counsel.
Mr. PARKS. I'm sorry.94COMMUNISMIN MTOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY
Mr. TAVENNER. My answer to that, Mr. Walter, is that althoughthere is information relating to some of these individuals as to whomI had expected to interrogate this witness, some of them have evadedservice of process, so that we cannot bring them here.That is onepoint.Another is that this committee ought to be entitled to receive proofof information which it has in its files as a result of its previous investigations relating to a matter of this kind. There would be no wayto really investigate Communist infiltration into labor without askingwho are Communists in labor.Hollywood.And the same thing is true here inThose are the reasons I think it is material.
Mr. WALTER. But isn't it far more important to learn the extent ofthe activity and what the purpose of the organization actually wasthan to get a long list of names of bleeding hearts and fools, suckers,hard-boiled Communist politicians? I don't know as it makes toomuch difference. As long as we have a witness willing and anxious tocooperate in carrying out what I conceive to be our purpose, I thinkthe rest is all immaterial.
Mr. TAVENNER. As to the other information-Mr. VELDE. Will the gentleman yield?
Mr. TAVENIER. May I make one statement ?
Mr. VELDE. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. As to the other information, as to the purposes andobjects of the various organizations, that was the subject of the testimony of about 20 witnesses or more here. I have referred to thoseorganizations, as organizations as to which there has been considerable evidence before your committee.
Mr. WALTER. May I ask this witness a question, Mr. Chairman, atthis point ?
Mr. WOOD. Yes. Mr. Walter.
Mr. WALTER. Were you instructed to attempt to influence the think-ing of the American people through various exhibitions on the stageor on the screen? Was that the purpose of your organization?
Mr. PARKS. I was never instructed at any time to do this, and Ithink that if you are a follower of the motion-picture industry-thatis, if you go to the movies is what I mean-if you are familiar with it,I think that it is almost evident that this was not done in pictures.
Mr. WALTER. Well, was it talked about ? Was it the purpose of theCommunist organization to attempt to set up a hard core in Hollywoodthat would slant pictures and performances so as to influence thethinking of the American people ?
Mr. PARKS. Not to my knowledge, Mr. Congressman, at all. As Isay, I was with a small group of actors. But as a person who is closeto the industry, I think that this is almost an impossibility. If you arefamiliar-you probably aren't-with the making of pictures, first ofall it's impossible I feel, as an actor, to do this as an actor. I wasnever asked to do it. It was never discussed. And I think it is im-possible.A script that is written is the important thing about making a picture. You can only make a stinker if you have a poor script.
Mr. WooD. On that point, wouldn't it be true that the writer of thatscript is in a position to very decidedly slant---COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREINiDUSTRY95
Mr. PARKS. No, sir; I don't believe this is true. I really and hon-Youestly don't believe that this is true. Because every studiosee, there are, I think, on the average of about 400 pictures made inHollywood, approximately. I don't know the exact number. I thinkit's something like that. This is divided up among a number ofstudios. A script passes through usually-and unfortunately-as anactor I think this-through too many hands. My personal opinionis that a script should be written by one man and it should be directedby the same man. But this happens hardly ever to my knowledge.It passes through several writers usually. They think if one man isgood for jokes, they put him in for jokes.And another man, if theywant a tear-jerker, they will assign him to that particular portionof it.It goes to an associate producer, a producer, the heads of the studios.And I think you are familiar with the men that are the heads of thestudios in Hollywood. And it is my opinion, it is my personal opinion,my studied opinion, that this is an impossibility. And to bear meoutMr. WooD. And didn't happen?
Mr. PARKS. I do not believe that this has ever happened.
Mr. WOOD. Very well. NowMr. PARKS. In my opinion.
Mr. WooD. Now, you're leaving a very decided impression on mymind that in your thinking there was nothing, no attempt to influencethe character of the pictures or other entertainment that emanated.from the studios that your group was connected with, and that therewas nothing off color about the action or the conduct of any of thepeople that belonged, to it. Then, how could it possibly reflect againstthe members of this group for the names to be known, any more thanit would if they belonged to the Young Men's Christian Association?
Mr. PARKS. May I answer this, Congressman?
Mr. WooD. Yes. I'm asking you.
Mr. PARKS. Yes. As a finish to what I said before, and I think tobear me out on what I said before, you may or may not like the picturethat comes out, and I am not saying that each picture is an artistic or acommercial masterpiece. This is not true. Everyone knows this.But I think this is the proof of what I say: That you cannot find onepicture that has been slanted adversely deliberately. This I do notbelieve.Again, a man can makea mistake in judgment, Congressman. Aman can make a mistake in judgment.Now, to answer your last question, I must-I feel as I do about itbecause myself I am a good example, I think. As I said before, it'snot easypersonally for me to be here. Anybody who thinks it is isout of their mind. Over and above that, it is doubtful whether, afterappearing before this committee, whether my career will continue. Itis extremely doubtful. For coming here and telling you the truth.You see, there were other things open to me that I could have done.But, feeling that I have not done anything wrong, that I will tell youthe truth. There were other things that were open to me that I couldhave done, and I chose not to do them.
Mr. WALTER. Actually, the producers, particularly in recent years,have been very careful to examine scripts so that they would not beslanted. Is that not the fact?96COMMUNISMIN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY
Mr. P.\Is. I think that this is correct. I think this is correct.
Mr. WOOD. I believe Mr. Doyle wanted to ask you a question. Mr.Doyle.
Mr. DOYLE. Mr. Parks, have you any knowledge of the extent towhich the movie industry, if it has, has made a conscientious effortto clean out any subversive influences in the industry either on thepart of the actors or otherwise? Are you conscious of any fixeddetermination since 1946 ?
Mr. PARKS. Yes, there certainly-I think that this is commonknowledge.
Mr. DOYLE. Well, is it part of your knowledge ?
Mr. PARKS. Yes, of course. When I say "common knowledge" Imean mine, yours, everybody's. I believe that everyone knows thatthere has been a conscious effort to be absolutely free of any kind ofcommunism.
Mr. DOYLE. May I ask this ? A few minutes ago you said you werefor a time honorary treasurer of one of these two groups that youstated you believed you were a member of. I think you said theextent of your duty as honorary treasurer was to sign a batch ofchecks all at the same time.
Mr. PARKS. That's right.
Mr. DOYLE. To whom were those checks written or for whatpurpose?
Mr. PARKS. Well, these were written to pay the office help, the secretaries, the clean-up man, the teachers, electric company, the utilitybills, bills for lumber and paint for scenery, et cetera.
Mr. DOYLE. Now, I noticed just now you said these checks werepaid for secretaries and office help. What secretaries? How rianysecretaries and what office help for what organization?
Mr. PARKS. For the Actors' Lab.
Mr. DOYLE. How many secretaries did you have ?
Mr. PARKS. Well, it varied from none to one to at certain timeswhen a show was being given and tickets were being mailed out toI don't really recall-possibly three, four.
Mr. DOYLE. Now, with reference to the cell which you said youattended some 12 or 15 times to the best of your recollectionMr. PARKS. Yes.
Mr. DOYLE. Was that attendance spread over from 1941 to 1945 ?
Mr. PARKS. That's correct.
Mr. DOYLE. Inclusive?
Mr. PARKS. That'sMr. DOYLE. I think you said your attendance averaged from 5 to 12or 15.
Mr. PARKS. Well, as I recall, it averaged from 5, 10, 12, in thatMr. DOYLE. Were the majority of those in attendance men orwomen ?
Mr. PARKS. I would say it was-I had never thought about it. Isuppose equally divided.
Mr. DOYLE. Did you recognize at each meeting at which you wereinattendance some actors and some actresses?
Mr. PARKS. That's correct.
Mr. DOYLE. About what proportion of the attendance, when 12 or15 were in attendance, were members of the actors' or actresses'group?COMMUNISMIN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY97
Mr. PARKS. Well, when I say 12, this as I recall-I'm using thisnumber. I don't recall the exact number. I think that probablywas the largest meeting. And these were all in the acting profession.
Mr. DOYLE. Then, am I to understand that the entire attendancewas, as far as you knew, members of the actors' profession?
Mr. PARKS. I believe that this is true.
Mr. DOYLE. Was this one cell limited to members of the actors'profession ?
Mr. PARKS. To the best of my knowledge, I believe it was limitedto that.
Mr. DOYLE. It was limited?
Mr. PARKS. I believe it was, yes.
Mr. DOYLE. And I think you said you more or less had a socialaffair. Did you have refreshments?
Mr. PARKS. Yes, we did. Coffee. Well, I'm serious when I saythat. Coffee, doughnuts.
Mr. DOYLE. Did the cell have dues?
Mr. PARKS. It did.
Mr. DOYLE. How much were the dues ?
Mr. PARKS. Well, again, it's difficult for me to say. As I recall,I thinkMr. DOYLE. How much did you pay?
Mr. PARKS. Well, duringMr. DOYLE. And how often?
Mr. PARKS. Well, during the course-I must explain to you a littleabout myself: That I'm not, I don't think, a stingy man, but I'mknown as a close man with a dollar, and I'm serious when I say this.And, to the best of my knowledge, I think during the short time Iwas connected with this organization that I could not have contributed more than 50, 60 dollars during this entire time.
Mr. DOYLE. You mean you were connected with this one cell from1941 to 1945, inclusive; yet you only paid a total of 50 or 60 dollarsin those 4 years?
Mr. PARKS. Well, the dues, as I recall, when you weren't workingwere about 75 cents a month, as I recall, and if you were workingI think you paid some percentage. I didn't.
Mr. DOYLE. TO what organization did you pay the dues as a memberof the cell?
Mr. PARKS. I gave them to-right at the meeting.
Mr. DOYLE. In check?
Mr. PARKS. No; I believe I gave them in cash.
Mr. DOYLE. Did you get a receipt for it?
Mr. PARKS. No.
Mr. DOYLE. Didn't ask for one?
Mr. PARKS. Didn't ask for it.
Mr. DOYLE. You mentioned that the cell members during the wardiscussed how the war was going. What did you mean by that?
Mr. PARKS. Well, at that particular time, this I think was themajor topic of conversation for most people in the country, and thiswas certainly true of myself and the actors that were at these particular meetings.
Mr. DOYLE. Were there ever any resolutions submitted to the cellfor consideration and action? I mean, were ever any communications read to you in the meeting from any other segment of the Com-98COMMUNISMINMOTION-PICTUREmunist Party, the Communist organization?INDUSTRYDid you ever listen toany communications read to you in any cell meeting those 4 years?If so, what?
Mr. PARKS. I honestly cannot say that I ever heard any such com-munication.I don't believe so.
Mr. DOYLE. Well, did anyone ever give you a report of any kind onCommunist Party activities in those 4 years at any of these cell meetings? If so, what report? Weren't you interested in the progressof the Communist Party? Didn't anyone send you reports or giveyou an oral report?
Mr. PARKs. Well, I think that certain things were mentioned atsome of these meetings that a certain number of people had been approached as far as our particular group was concerned, and this wasabout the extent of it as I recall.
Mr. DOYLE. That was going to be my next question.Basing thisquestion on the fact that you deliberately laid the groundwork thatyou were idealistic, liberal, and progressive at the age of 25, and soforth, and that is perhaps one reason you joined the Communist Party,or at least you
Mr. PARKS.
Mr. DOYLE.
Mr. PARKS.
Mr. DOYLE.gave it as one reason for your joining itNo; that is the reason.Well, of courseI gave it as the reason.May I ask this? You have just stated now that re-ports were made as to people being approached. Now, you madean effort-didn't you ?-as a member of the cell-didn't that cell makeefforts to increase its own membership in Hollywood ?
Mr. PARKS. I personally, to the best of my knowledge, never madesuch an effort.
Mr. DOYLE. No; but you heard reports of what was being done bythe cell?
Mr. PARKS. That's correct.
Mr. DOYLE. Well, what reports were given as to the activities of thecell?
Mr. PARKS. Well, I don't remember. It's been a long time ago asI told you.And I'm not trying to evade this question at all.I'mhonestly not. But a minor report was probably made. I don't recallsubstances of any of these. ThatMr. DOYLE. Well, now, you notice, Parks, I'm deliberately avoiding at this time asking you names of any other person.
Mr. PARKS. Yes.
Mr. DOYLE. For the purpose of my questioning, I am assuming youwant to be helpful to the committee and tell the activities of the cellthat you were in.
Mr. PARKS. That's correct, and I am doing this.
Mr. DOYLE. Now, manifestly, the cell was trying to increase itsmembership, wasn't it ?
Mr. PARKS. That's correct.
Mr. DOYLE. And you were a member of the cell?
Mr. PARKS. That's correct.
Mr. DOYLE. You testified that you heard reportsMr. PARKS. Well, as I sayMr. DOYLE (continuing). -of what the cell was doing to increaseits membership.COMMUNISM INMOTION-PICTUREINiDUSTRY99
Mr. PARKS. Well, you're really going a bit further than I said,Congressman.
Mr. DOYLE. Well, you go as far as you honestly can and tell us whatactivities the cell participated in to increase its membership.
Mr. PARKS. Well, I think that certain members of the groupapproached people about becoming a member of the Communist Party.I myself never did this. I have never-
Mr. DOYLE. Well, names were submitted of other prospective mem-bers in your presence; were they not ? Names of prospective memberswere read off or possibilities were read off or submitted to the cellmembership; weren't they?
Mr. PARKS. It's possible that this was done.
Mr. DOYLE. Well, was it done?
Mr. PARKS. As I say, it's been a long time ago.I'm not evadingthe question at all. But, as I told you, I attended a very few meetings.I was not considered a good member. I'm not clear and articulateabout everything that happened, because I know very little of whathappened.
Mr. DoiLE'.Well, was any difference in philosophy between commu-nism and our form of government ever discussed in the cell? Whatdid you discuss besides drinking coffee ?
Mr. PARKS. Well, we didn't discuss drinking coffee; we just drank it.As I told you, at that particular time the war was going on, and thiswas of major importance to every American at the time; and this, asI recall, was the major topic of conversation most of the time.Then, the discussions also evolved around current events of thetime. They also had to do with conditions of actors, as we were, as Irecall, all actors-how we could get more money and better conditions.These were the major topics of conversation as I recall them.
Mr. DoYEI.Well, was it discussed among you that you could getmore money as a member of the Communist Party than you could justbeing a plain Democrat or Republican or member of some other partyor not being a member of any party ?
Mr. PARKS. No; this was never discussed to my knowledge at all.And, as a matter of factMr. DOYLE. What was the Communist Party membership in thiscell going to do for you in Hollywood ? What were the benefits of it ?Why did you join the cell? What did you get out of it or hope to getout of it ?
Mr. PARKS. As I told you, as a young man of 25, with ideals and afeeling for the underdog, I felt at the time that this was a legitimatepolitical party, like you would join the Democrats or Republicans,andMr. DOYTL.interrupt.When did you first begin to feel-I don't mean to
Mr. PARKS. Excuse me. Could I just continue ?
Mr. DOYLE. I think you gave that answer a few minutes ago, thesame answer you are giving now.
Mr. PARKS. No; 1 really didn't. I felt at the time that this was themost liberal of the political parties of the time. You might be interested to know that all of this time I was a registered Democrat. Istill am. And I have voted from that time and before it the straightDemocratic ticket, because this was the practical thing to do. Theother was an idealistic thing.81595-51-pt. 1-4100COMMUNISMINMOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY
Mr. DOYLE. NOW, may I ask you this, my final question I thinkfor now: You were in that cell from 1941 to 1945, inclusive, as Iunderstand your answer?
Mr. PARKs. As I said, from 1941, as I recall, to 1944 or 1945.
Mr. DOYLE. Approximately.
Mr. PARKS. Approximately that.
Mr. DOYLE. About how many years were you in that cell beforeyou began to be disillusioned-the proposition that perhaps the partyyou joined was not the answer to your idealism? How long did ittake you to come to that conclusion before you dropped out?
Mr. PARKS. Well, "disillusion" is not the exact word that I wouldchoose, I don't think, at that particular time.
Mr. WOOD. Do I understand from that answer, sir, that you arenot yet disillusioned about it?
Mr. PARKS. No, no. Don't bend it. Because I don't mean it thatway at all. I am answering this Congressman's question to the bestof my knowledge that it wasn't a question of disillusionment reallyat that time. It was a question of lack of interest, of not findingyou may call it disillusionment if you want, but not finding the thingsthat, as a young man with those particular feelings, I thought I wouldfind.
Mr. DOYLE. Were most of the 12 or 15 occasions on which youattended in 1941, 1942, and 1943, or were most of them in 1944 and1945 ? How would you estimate?
Mr. PARKS. Well, it would be hard for me to estimate that, because when I was-I began to work more, and when I worked I didn'tgo. And it would be hard for me to say, through this lack of interestin not finding what as a young man I was looking for, whether thesewere at the beginning or the end. I do know that it just petered outlike a spent rocket.
Mr. KEARNEY. Will the gentleman yield ?
Mr. DOYLE. I just want one more question:
Mr. Parks, of course, you were well acquainted with some of themembers of the cell?
Mr. PARKS. Could I just explain one other thing when I say "whenI worked I didn't go"? If you know anything about an actor'swork, it goes from 6 in the morning till 7:30, 8 at night, and whenyou do work you really don't have much time for anything else. AndI have finished my forty-first picture in 10 years. And this means Ihave been working pretty hard.
Mr. DOYLE. I greatly respect the dedication of you artists to yourprofession and the diligence with which you work at it. Now, letme ask this further question: You, of course, in these 4 or 5 yearsbecame acquainted with some of the members of the cell?
Mr. PARKS. With what?
Mr. DOYLE. You became acquainted with some other members ofthe cell, so you had a talking acquaintance at least?
Mr. PARKS. That's correct.
Mr. DOYLE. Now, did you ever discuss with some other membersof the cell the fact that you were becoming less satisfied or not satisfied? That is, that you didn't find in the Communist Party membership that which you had hoped ?
Mr. PARKS. I believe that I did.
Mr. DOYLE. With men or women ?COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY101But I am sure-I don't recallthe conversations, but I am sure that these did take place.
Mr. PARKs. This I cannot recall.
Mr. DOYLE. What was the substance of their expressed attitude toyou ? Did they agree with you or did they disagree with you ?
Mr. PARKS. Well, as I recall, many times people agreed with whatI felt, how I felt. This is one of the reasons that I feel as I do aboutthe people that I knew at that particular time, because I don't recallany time anyone giving me a really serious argument about the wayI felt.
Mr. DOYLE. While you were a member of that ccll from 1941 to1945, did it come at all clearly to you that the Communist Party waspart of an international conspiracy against our form of government?Did you ever come to that conclusion while you were a member ofthe cell?
Mr. PARKS. No; not while I was a member of that particular group.As I told you, I didn't find the things that I had hoped to find.
Mr. KEARNEY. Will the gentleman yield at this point ?
Mr. DOYLE. Let me ask this last question. I appreciate your generosity, General.Did you, while a member of that cell, come to the conclusion eitherin part or in whole that the Communist Party program was aimedat world domination ?
Mr. PARKS. Not at that particular time; I did not.
Mr. DOYLE. When did you come to that conclusion, if at all?
Mr. PARKS. Well, I think the way most everybody has come to thatconclusion, with the recent and not so recent events in the historyof the world, in the history of our country.
Mr. DOYLE. One more question.
Mr. PARKS. This what is happening now. I think this is selfevident to most everybody.
Mr. DOYLE. Did you make any effort yourself, Larry Parks, as amember of this cell, to increase its membership ?
Mr. PARKS. I do not recall ever making an effort to increaseMr. DOYLE. Did you ever see or observe any other member of thatcell do any act designed to increase the membership in the cell?
Mr. PARKS. I personally don't recall ever having seen this, and thisis an honest and truthful answer.
Mr. KEARNEY. Mr. Chairman-
Mr. WOOD. General Kearney.Mr IKEAREY Mr Parks, there was one portion of your testimonythat I cannot understand I cannot understand your lack of interestin the Communist Party, when, from your own testimony, no memberof the Communist Party ever appeared at any of the meetings attendedby yourself and spoke.
Mr. PARKS. I don't understand the question. Would you repeat it?
Mr. KEARNEY. Well, you testified some few minutes ago that nomember of the Communist Party ever appeared and spoke before anyof the meetings that you attended.
Mr. PARKS. No; I don't believe I said this. I don't believe I said thisat all.
Mr. KEARNEY. That is my strong recollection of your testimony.
Mr. PARKS. What I said, that to my recollection no-I think I usedthe words "big shot."102COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY
Mr. KEARNEY. Well, were there members of the Communist Partywho appeared at your meetings and spoke to your group?
Mr. P.ARKs. We were all at that particular time members of theCommunist Party.
Mr. KEARNEY. I mean from other cells outside of your own.
Mr. PARKS. There was one instance that I do recall when this didhappen.
Mr. KEARNEY. Can you give his name?
Mr. PARKS. Again I wish you would not press me.
Mr. WOOD. I will state for the benefit of the members we are going totake a recess perhaps for a very short time for lunch, at which time Iask the committee to assemble back in the room for the purpose of.determining this matter of policy, and after we resume the witness willbe advised what the disposition of this committee is with reference tohis apparent disinclination to answer questions.
Mr. VELDE. Mr. Chairman, I would like to ask one question. I don'tpropose to prolong this discussion very much further. But, as Iremember it, you stated that you now believe that the CommunistParty of the United States is a subversive organization. Is that true ?
Mr. PARKS. I thought you were going on. Is that the end?
Mr. VELDE. IS that true ?
Mr. PARKS. Yes; I do.
Mr. VELDE. But at that time that you went into the CommunistParty, you felt that it was not a subversive organization ?
Mr. PARKS. That is quite correct.
Mr. VELDE. Well, do you now know that at the time you belongedto the Communist Party it actually was a subversive organizationat that time ?
Mr. PARKS. Again this is only a personal opinion. What I observed at that time, I cannot say that this was true. What I observepersonally, the experiences that I had with the small group of peoplethat I knew, this is the only way that I can judge.
Mr. VELDE. Well, you have a pretty strong feeling, though, evenat that time that you were duped, that you didn't actually know thepurposes of the Communist Party? Isn't that true, Mr. Parks?
Mr. PARKS. No. Again I say I will make no apologies, you see,for what I did except the mistake in judgment, and it's debatable.
Mr. VELDE. Well, your judgment was at that time that it was nota subversive or disloyal organization?
Mr. PARKS. This is my considered judgment.
Mr. VELDE. And you realize now that that judgment was wrong?That it actually was a subversive organization at that time ?
Mr. PARKS. I can only give you what I experienced myself, yousee, what little I knew about it, and this is the only way that a mancan judge.
Mr. VELDE. I'm asking for your judgment at this time as to whetheror not you were mistaken in your judgment and actually that theCommunist Party was a subversive organization at that time.
Mr. PARKS. Well, this is very hard for me to say. It really is. Because I honestly don't know. What I felt about it during that time,what I observed-that nothing wrong was ever done, you see.
Mr. VELDE. It's not what you felt during that time, Mr. Parks.It's what you feel now about the Communist Party at that time.COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE
Mr. PARKS. What IINDUSTRY103feel now is entirely different thari what I feltthen.other words, now you feel that it was a subversiveorganization at that time?
Mr. PARKS. I think a great change has occurred in this particularorganization. That is my opinion.
Mr. WALTER. In other words, you feel that the "do-gooders" havegotten out of it and there is nothing remaining now except the hardboiled politicians ?
Mr. PARKS. I would say that in substance I agree with this perfectly.
Mr. VELDE. Mr. ParksMr. PARKS. There possibly can be exceptions to this, but certainlynot in the major part at all.
Mr. VELDE. Mr. Parks, how could you possibly know how othermembers of your particular cell felt about the purposes of the organization-that is, the Communist Party organization ?
Mr. PARKS. Well, at this particular time during the war, a commonpurpose united all of the people of this country-practically all of thepeople of this country.
Mr. VELDE. I don't think you are answering my question, Mr. Parks.I realize your reluctance in telling the membership of your organization.
Mr. PARKS. Would you repeat the question then ? I didn'tMr. VELDE. Just a moment. Let me finish, please. We had a witness down here last year, Lee.Pressman, who was likewise reluctantto answer questions concerning his association with members of hisown Communist Party cell, but eventually he did, and the committeereceived his testimony, and it did the committee a lot of good to realizethat he would give the testimony. We realize that is true, and Iunderstand your reluctance, but I think you will agree that the committee is a legally organized committee and has a function to do.
Mr. PARKS. I agree with this perfectly.
Mr. VELDE. And as such it has the right to inquire as to the namesof members of the Communist Party during the past.
Mr. PARKS. This is your right.
Mr. WooD. Mr. Counsel, did you have one further question beforewe adjourn?
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes, sir. I would like to ask just one or two questions.
Mr. Parks, you are no doubt acquainted with Mr. Samuel G. Wood,a motion-picture producer and director, or at least you were acquaintedwith him?
Mr. PARKS. Well, I don't believe that I have ever met the gentleman. I'm quite-if this is the man that died a year or two ago-Mr. VELDE. In
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes.
Mr. PARKS (continuing) : I'm an admirer of his work as a director.I don't believe I have ever met him. I don't recall meeting him.
Mr. TAVENNER. But you know of whom I am speaking ?
Mr. PARKS. Yes, I do. Sam Wood? Right?104COMMUNISM LN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY
Mr. TAVENNl s. Yes. Now he testified before this committee withregard to the Laboratory Theater as follows:Well, in the old days we used to have youngsters who had a chance to study tobecome actors and actresses through the stock companies. Every city had twoor three stock companies. But now most of them have been eliminated. Theyhave to go to these schools. They put on plays. They get parts. They studyand become efficient, and we see them in the theaters or see them in somePasadena Playhouse or something like that. But the Laboratory Theater I thinkis definitely under the control of the Communist Party and the people that teachthere. Any kid that goes in there with American ideals hasn't a chance in theworld.Do you agree with his statement ?
Mr. PARKS. I disagree with this emphatically. I disagree with itemphatically.
Mr. TAVENNER. But do you agree that Mr. Wood is a man or honorand integrity ?
Mr. PARKS. I agree that Mr. Wood is a man that turned out manyfine motion pictures. I don't know the gentleman. I never knew him,and I don't recall ever having met him. But I disagree with thisemphatically.
Mr. TAVENNER. But do you still feel that in light of that testimonyregarding Mr. Wood you should be the judge as to whether or not youtestify as to who were connected with the theaterMr. PARKS. No. At no time did .I say that I was to be the judge.I was explaining my position to you. I have opened myself to you.And I am asking you gentlemen to be the judge, because this is not myduty here. I am a witness. You gentlemen must be the judge of this.
Mr. TAVENNER. But you see there is a vast difference apparently between your opinion of the activities of that organization and theopinion of others who have testified before this committee.
Mr. PARKS. Well, let me tell you then about the activities of thisorganization, and then you form your own opinion. This I thinkwould be the only fair thing to do.
Mr. TAVENNER. Proceed.
Mr. PARKS. The activities of the Lab I think were admirable. Ididn't happen to agree with certain of the objectives from a professional point of view. This was my disagreement. The work of theLab I think has been very fine. I think that from a standpoint ofMr. Wood was quite correct when he said that there is no place, hardly,today where an actor can get his training as he used to, except nowadays recently the summer theaters have come up.I feel that the Actors' Lab as a training ground for actors was probably the finest of its kind, with the finest courses and the finest directors. It had the cream of the talent appearing on its stages and forthe Army. I personally, for instance, appeared in three shows that wetoured all over the Army camps,and Old Lace, Kiss and Tell.couldn't possibly have affordedNo producer could be this rich.f1ke Three Men on a Horse, ArsenicThey had the greatest casts. Youthese kinds of casts on Broadway.Because these people from the bitsto the starring parts were giving of their time.These are the reasons. I think the record of the lab speaks foritself as far as its activities are concerned and the good that it hasdone. And I can't prove to you that it was a good acting school.This is impossible. But in my opinion as an actor, this was a fineacting school.COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY105
Mr. TAVENNER. I am not questioning the skill of the group that wereworking there.
Mr. PARKS. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. I am talking about the influences---Mr. PARKS. That's right.
Mr. TAVENNER (continuing). Through Communist Party circles.
Mr. PARKS. The only way that you can influence through an organ-ization like the lab, in my opinion, is by the kind of material andthe way it is done. Now, if you go down the list of the plays and theclassics and the modern plays that the lab has done, everything fromShakespeare and before, playwrights of all countries, this is the onlyway I think that you can judge the worth of an organization like this.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, do you agree that it was the object and purpose of the Communist Party to exert an influence through the profes-sionals in Hollywood in the advancement of the cause of communism?
Mr. PARKS. No; I cannot agree with this at all.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you acquainted with the report on the NationalConvention in Relation to Cultural Movement by V. J. Jerome, deliv-ered in 1938 ?
Mr. PARKS. No; I am not.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, let me read this paragraph to you:And further we must more than ever impress the professions, our friends andsympathizers, that we have a positive approach also to their work. It isn't justa question-they shouldn't imagine that they are just brought into the party asthough to be turned into instruments apart from their work, but on the contrarythat their coming into the party was their being friends of the party and sympathizers as in terms of their actual work. We do not always make this clear.The party increasingly cherishes and values specific qualities that the professionals bring into our midst. Gone is the day when we just took a professionalcomrade and assigned him to do nondescript party work. We say, on the contrary, "Comrades, you have something specific to give. You have the general contributions to make in your loyalty, in your dues payment, your attendance and,your various duties and tasks to perform, but you have also a different contribution to make, whether you are a writer, a film artist, a radio performer. Weneed this, no matter how valuable you are to the party on the picket line, and if inyour turn you do not contribute you would not really be valuable to us." This isimportant to register. And we must also register the fact that the party is notsatisfied with anything save the best in terms of quality and caliber and talentthat the comrades can produce. Our motto is nothing is too good for the working class, and not, as some say, and possibly by their inferior work, not becausethey are unable to do better but a sort of sloppy arrangement, that anythingis good enough for the working class. We want quality. We want good leaflets,splendid posters such as the Communist Party of Germany used to put out whenartists such as Kathe Kollwitz gave of their best to poster production, and,of course, murals and everything that is good. We want our basic agitationalwork to reflect that we have talented professionals in our midst, good sketches,good plays. In fact, unless the form is there the content is not there.Doesn't that indicate to you a very definite and determined plan andperfected plan on the part of the Communist Party to use its Communist Party cells in the advancement of its program in Hollywood aswell as elsewhere?
Mr. PARKs. That would be my impression from listening to youread that.
Mr. TAVENNER. In the entertainment field?
Mr. PARKS. I can only give you what I personally know and whatmy particular knowledge is on this, what my opinion is about certainthings.106COMMUNISMINMOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY
Mr. JACKSON. Mr. Chairman, may I ask one question before we ad-journ?
Mr. WOO. . Yes,, Mr. Jackson.
Mr. JACKSON. Mr. Parks, why in your opinion were you solicitedfor membership in the Communist Party ?
Mr. PARKS. Well. I imagine I wasn't working at the time so it wasnot from a standpoint of getting any kirid of working actor. I imaginethat it was because I was young and probably, as I said, idealistic,and my views on the underprivileged and the underdog were probablyknown at the time, and I imagine that this was the reason.
Mr. JACKSON. You think it had nothing to do with your poten-tialities as an actor?That you were solicited just as someone downon Skid Row might have been taken into the party ?
Mr. PARKS. Well, perhaps not quite to that extreme.I hope itwasn't quite to that extreme. But at the time-I started to say I hateto admit it, but I really don't-I was not considered to have much talentas an actor by many people. As a matter of fact, I'm rather proud nowof a certain progress that I have made I think as an actor myself.I always thought I had possibilities, but I was practically the onlyone that thought this. And I don't think that it was from that viewpoint that I was approached at all. I don't mean to give you a facetious answer, because it's not; this is true.
Mr. JACKSON. You say that today you are entirely out of sympathywith the Communist philosophy and with its outward manifestationsas they have appeared in recent years since your separation from theparty?
Mr. PARKS. I certainly am. I think that any power that is tryingto, in my opinion, take over the world in this manner, I think is wrong.
Mr. JACKSON. I think a concomitant of that would be, then, that incase of armed conflict between the United States and the Soviet Unionyou would bear arms in defense of the United States?
Mr. PARKS. Without question.
Mr. WooD. We will take a recess at this time until 2: 30.(Thereupon, at 12: 35 p. m., the hearing was recessed, to reconveneat 2:30 p. m. this date.)AFTERNOON SESSION(The committee reconvened at 2: 30 p. m., pursuant to the recess.)
Mr. WooD. The committee will be in order.Let the record show that the members present are: Messrs. Walter,Doyle, Frazier, Velde, Kearney, Jackson, Potter, and Wood.
Mr. MANDEL (counsel for the witness). Mr. Chairman, Mr. Parkswould like to make a further application and talk to the committeeabout the question of naming names.He would appreciate it if thecommittee would hear him out a few minutes, what he has to say onthe subject.
Mr. WooD. I thought he expressed himself pretty fully this morning.We are taking a good deal of time on this hearing. I think counselhas a few more questions. Maybe they will bring out what he wantsto say.
Mr. MANDEL. What he has to say, I think, is very pertinent at thispoint. I don't think we can judge it until he says it. It will only takeCOMMUNISMIN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY107him 3 minutes or so to say it. In view of the fact he has cooperatedso completely with the committee, I think he should be granted 3minutes to say what he has to say, then he is willing to be guided bythe committee.
Mr. WooD. I see no objection to it.
Mr. Parks.
Mr. PARKS. I will, Mr. Chairman.Make it as brief as you can,TESTIMONY OF LARRY PARKS, ACCOMPANIED BY HIS COUNSEL,LOUIS MANDEL--Resumed
Mr. PARKS. To be an actor, a good actor, you must really feel andexperience, from the top of your head to the tip of your toes, whatyou are doing. As I told you, this is probably the most difficultmorning and afternoon I have spent, and I wish that if it was at allpossible-you see, it is a little different to sit there and to sit here, andfor a moment if you could transfer places with me, mentally, and putyourself in my place.My people have a long heritage in this country. They fought inthe Revolutionary War to make this country, to create this Government, of which this committee is a part. I have two boys, one .13months, one 2 weeks. Is thi's the kind of heritage that I must handdown to them? Is this the kind of heritage that you would like tohand down to your children? And for what purpose? Children asinnocent as I am or you are; people you already know.I don't think I would be here today if I weren't a star, because youknow as well as I, even better, that I know nothing that I believe wouldbe of great service to this country. I think my career has been ruinedbecause of this, and I would appreciate not having to-don't presentme with the choice of either being in contempt of this committee andgoing to jail or forcing me to really crawl through the mud to be aninformer, for what purpose? I don't think this is a choice at all.I don't think this is really sportsmanlike. I don't think this is American. I don't think this is American justice. I think to do somethinglike that is more akin to what happened under Hitler, and what ishappening in Russia today.I don't think this is American justice for an innocent mistake injudgment, if it was that, with the intention behind it only of makingthis country a better place in which to live. I think it is not befittingfor this committee to force me to make this kind of a choice. I don'tthink it is befitting to the purpose of the committee to do this.As I told you, I think this is probably the most difficult thing I havedone, and it seems to me it would impair the usefulness of this committee to do this, because God knows it is difficult enough to come beforethis committee and tell the truth. There was another choice open tome. I did not choose to use it. I chose to come and tell the truth.If you do this to me, I think it will impair the usefulness of thiscommittee to a great extent, because it will make it almost impossiblefor a person to come to you, as I have done, and open himself to youand tell you the truth. So I beg of you not to force me to do this.
Mr. WooD. Proceed.108COMMUNISMIN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY
Mr. T.\VENER. Mr. Parks, there was a statement you made thismorning in the course of your testimony which interested me a greatdeal. This is what you said:This is a great industry-speaking of the moving picture industryand I don't say this only because it has been kind to me. It has a very importantjob to do, to entertain people; in certain respects to call attention to certain evils,but mainly to entertain.Now, do you believe that the persons who are in a position to callattention to certain evils ought to be persons who are dedicated to theprinciples of democracy as we understand them in this country?
Mr. PARKS. I certainly agree with this completely.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you believe, on the other hand, that the personswho are in those responsible positions should be people who are antagonistic to the principles of democracy and our form of government,and who are members of a conspiracy to overthrow our Government ?
Mr. PARKS. Most assuredly I don't.
Mr. TAVENNER. Then what is your opinion as to whether or notmembers of the Communist Party should be in positions of power andinfluence in the various unions which control the writing of scripts,the actors, and various other things which we have mentioned duringthe course of this hearing relating to the great industry of the movingpictures?
Mr. PARKS. I thought I had made myself clear, my feeling aboutthis, that I certainly do not believe that those people should be inany position of power to be able to direct this. Of course, I don'tbelieve that.
Mr. TAVENER. Or to influence the course which it takes?
Mr. PARKS. That is correct.
Mr. TAVENNER. Then we will ask your cooperation, before thishearing is over, in helping us to ascertain those who are or have beenmembers of the Communist Party, for that particular purpose whichwe have mentioned.
Mr. Parks, it is generally known and recognized that the Communist Party, in order to function, must raise money by variousmethods. Will you tell us what you know of the methods by whichmoney was raised to promote the objects and purposes of the Communist Party while you were a member ?
Mr. PARKS. Well, unfortunately, I don't believe I am able to answerthat, because I don't recall any occasion of that kind of raising thiskind of money that you speak of. When I was a member of the Com-munist Party I paid dues to it, as I told you, and rather meagercontributions. I don't believe I can help you on this, because I reallydon't know.
Mr. TAVINNER. Did you take any part in fund-raising campaignswhich were engineered by the Communist Party or by organizationsknown to you to be Communist-front organizations?
Mr. PARKS. I don't recall at the moment. This is like asking a manwhat he did in 1941, and he says, "I don't remember." If you say tohim, "Did you go fishing up on the Oregon River?" he will say, "Yes,yes, I did." If you would accommodate me in this way perhaps I cananswer your question.COMMUNISMIN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY109
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you make contributions to any organizationswhich you knew at the time or have known since to be cited as Communist-front organizations?
Mr. PARKS. I believe that before the Independent Artists' Committee, whatever it is called, was cited, I contributed to them $2 a month.
Mr. TAVENNER. Over how long a period of time?
Mr. PARKS. A year or so, I guess. At the time it was to my mind aperfectly legitimate organization. It has been cited since, I believe, bythe Attorney General in his list of organizations. Others might be.I don't recall them .at the moment.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you take part in any benefit performance, bene-fit celebration, on behalf of Communist-front organizations?
Mr. PARKS. As an actor, Counsel, I have taken part in many bene-fits for many organizations over the last 10 years. If you could bemore specific, perhaps I could answer better.
Mr. TAVENNER. Have you taken part in any such celebration wherethe proceeds would go to a Communist-front organization which youknew had been cited as a Communist-front organization, or which youlater found out had been cited?
Mr. PARKS. I don't remember at the moment, but if you could bemore specific.
Mr. TAVENNER. No. I am asking if you recall.
Mr. PARKS. I don't recall at the moment. If you could be morespecific, perhaps I could answer better.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you know anything of Communist Party plansfor raising money for various purposes in which the CommunistParty was interested?
Mr. PARKS. No; I can't honestly recall knowing about this. Again,if you could be more specific, perhaps I could answer you more specifically, if you could give me an instance of what you want to know, orwhat you are driving at.
Mr. TAVENNER. I am merely asking what you know about the raisingof Communist Party funds.
Mr. PARKS. At the moment I don't recall knowing anything aboutit. As I just told you, I have appeared in many benefits over the pastfew years for many organizations, and if you could be more specificperhaps I could be more specific. I am not trying to avoid the question.
Mr. TAVENNER. I have no trick question hereattempting to lead you into denial of something
Mr. PARKs. I have come here and have been asas I can. I think the testimony will bear me out.you all I can if you could be more specific.through which I amwe know about.open and aboveboardI am willing to helpAs I told you, I haveappeared at many benefits over many years.
Mr. TAVENNER. As far as you know, were any of these fund-raisingbenefits conducted for the benefit of the Communist Party?
Mr. PARKS. I don't recall any at the moment. But again I say, Ihave been to many benefits over many years.
Mr. TAVENNER. In your statement that you made at the beginningof the afternoon session, you made a statement which I cannot let goby without challenging it.You said you were subpenaed here becauseyou were a star. Mr. Parks, you were subpenaed here because thecommittee had information that you had knowledge about CommunistParty activities and that you had been a member.110COMMUNISMIN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY
Mr. PARKS. I did not mean any inference )bythat, Counsel.All Imeant was that I think yon know. even better than I, that I knownothing of any conspiracy that is trying to overthrow this Government. You know this even better than I. And my point was that Ithink if I was working in a drug store. I doubt very much whetherI would be here.
Mr. TAVENNER. We have had many people before this committeewho have been engaged in very menial forms of making a livelihood,and that will be so in the future.
Mr. PuRKs. Please don't take that in the wrong spirit, because itwas not meant in the wrong spirit.
Mr. TAVENNER. I am glad it was not.I did not fully understand your reference to the possible destructionof your career by being subpenaed here. You did not mean to inferby that that this committee was bringing you here because of anyeffect it might have on your career ?
Mr. PARKS. NO, I.didn't infer that at all. What I meant, and whatI said, was that because of this, in my opinion, I have no career left.
Mr. TAVENNER. Don't you think that that question might be influ-enced to some extent by the fullness of the cooperation that you givethe committee in a situation of this kind ?
Mr. PARKS. I have tried to cooperate with the committee in everyway that I feel that I can, but I think the damage has been done. Thisis my personal opinion.
Mr. TAVENNER. Those are all the questions I have at this time, Mr.Chairman.
Mr. WOOD. Any questions?
Mr. JAcKsox. Don't you think that more than the damage thatpossibly has been done you by this committee, which, after all, is anexpression of the will of the American people and operates underthe mandate of the people-don't you think the great damage occurredwhen you became a member of an organization which has been foundto advocate the overthrow of every constitutional form of governmentin the world? Is this committee more to blame than your own actin affiliating with that organization?
Mr. PARKS. As I told you, Congressman, when I was a good dealyounger than I am now, 10 years ago, I felt a certain way aboutcertain things. I was an idealist, I felt strongly and I still do aboutthe underdog, and it was for these reasons that this particular organization appealed to me at that time. I have later found that thiswould not fulfill my needs. At that time, this, I don't even believewas a mistake. It may have been a mistake in judgment. This isdebatable. But my two boys, for instance, I would rather have themmake the same mistake I did under those circumstances than notfeel like making any mistake at all and be a cow in the pasture. Ifa man doesn't feel that way about certain things, then he is not aman. The thing that I did-I do not believe that I did anythingthat was wrong. Judgment, this is debatable. This I agree.
Mr. JACKSON. You say, Mr. Parks, that your association at bestwas haphazard, and, in your own words, you are afraid you werenot a very good Communist.
Mr. PARKS. That is correct.
Mr. JACKSON. Upon what do you base the opinion that the peoplewhose names you have in your possession probably have severed their111COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRYrelations with the Communist Party or are not today members of theCommunist Party ?
Mr. PARKS. In my opinion, the few people that I knew are peoplelike myself and feel the way that I do.
Mr. JACKSON. Well, of course, that is merely your judgment of thematter. Have you discussed their party affiliations with those withwhom you were affiliated in the party?
Mr. PARKS. I have not, but these people I knew. and this is myhonest opinion.as I do.You know these people.You know them as well
Mr. JACKSON. I will point out to you that in a recent case here inWashington some of the highest officials in Government testified onthe stand to their honest belief that a man with whom they had beenassociated had never been a member of the Communist Party, andin no way constituted any threat to our institutions, but every manwho reads the newspapers knows how fallacious that opinion was.I merely point out that after all, in all good faith, you might conceivably be entirely wrong as to the present status of membershipin the Communist Party of some people whose names you evidencehesitancy about disclosing.
Mr. PARKS.. These men you speak of did not act as informers inany sense of the word. I told you about these people. You knowwho the people are. And I have told you my opinion of them. AndI have told you that I think to force me to do something like this isnot befitting this committee. I don't think the committee wouldbenefit from it, and I don't think this is American justice to makeme choose one or the other or be in contempt of this committee, whichis a committee of my government, or crawl through the mud for nopurpose, because you know who these people are. This is what I begyou not to do.
Mr. JACKSON. This is also problematic, Mr. Parks.I know whothey are, maybe you are entirely right, but I still think it is withinthe province of the committee to determine how far they will go inthis respect.
Mr. PARKS. I am asking the committee not to do it.setting myself up as a judge.I am asking you to judge.I am not
Mr. VELDE. I think you are wrong in assuming we know all of theactivities in which you were engaged and all the people you wereengaged in those activities with.

Mr. KENNY. The motion was to quash the subpena. If he is notproperly subpenaed, if the motion is denied, of course the record hasbeen made, but as it now stands there is a motion pending beforethe committee that the subpena be quashed, on the ground that Mr.Da Silva is not a witness -but rather a defendant in a proceedingwhich may have the effect of depriving him of his livelihood, and assuch a defendant he cannot be called at all to testify against himself.That is why the motion was addressed to the subpena. I suggestthe logical way to handle that would be to grant or deny the motionto quash the.subpena, then if the motion is denied the record will bemade and the witness will be available to be sworn.
Mr. WOOD. I don't think this committee has authority to rule on alegal question as to the subpena. We have the power of subpena, butthat is a question that will have to be raised in court at the proper time.
Mr. KENNY. If the record discloses the motion has been made--Mr. WooD. Let the record disclose that this telegram, in the natureof a motion, has been presented to the committee and will be placedin the record.(The telegram above referred to is as follows:)OHICAGO, ILL., March 20, 1951.HON.

This motion will be made upon the grounds thatour clients have not been subpenaed merely as witnesses but rather they occupythe positron of defendants charged with political heresy in a proceeding whichcan result in deprivation of their livelihoods. No one in such a position can becalled to the stand and compelled to testify against himself. (See first andfifth amendments, United States Constitution. Adamson v. California (332 U. S.46) ; Boyd v.

Mr. TAVENNER. 'Will you state your full name, please?
Mr. DA SILVA. I would like to voice my objection now, if I may.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you state your full name, please ?
Mr. DA SILVA. May I not voice my objection ?
Mr. TAVENNER. You have not yet been identified in the record.
Mr. DA SILVA. My name is Howard Da Silva. I was born HowardSilverblatt. I was born in Cleveland, Ohio, May 4, 1909.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you furnish the committee, please, with abrief resume of your educational background.
Mr. DA SILVA. Mr. Chairman, I have a statement which I wouldlike very much to make. It has been announced in the press thatthis committee has as its purpose complete objectivity, and I thinkin the face of that it is quite important that I present my own statementhere for clarity and for objectivity. Here is the statement I wouldlike to present [handing statement to counsel].
Mr. TAVENNER. IS this the same statement that counsel sent in tothe committee a while ago ?
Mr. KENNY. No; I don't think we sent a statement in. It may bea statement of which you have seen a copy.
Mr. TAVENNER. Is it a statement that was given to the press ?
Mr. DA SILVA. It was given to the press.
Mr. WooD. This is a statement that you released to the press ?
Mr. DA SILVA. What is that?
Mr. WooD. This statement you now desire to read is a statementthat you released to the press?
Mr. DA SILvA. Simultaneously with my appearance; yes.
Mr. WooD. Let's see if I understand you correctly. When did yourelease this statement which you now propose to read?
Mr. DA SILVA. I was called here at 10 o'clock this morning.
Mr. WooD. When did you release the statement to the press ?
Mr. DA SILVA.- Shortly after I arrived here.
Mr. WooD. Shortly after 10, and it is now after 3. In the lightof the fact it has been given this wide publicity, I see no purpose inburdening the record with a repetition of it.
Mr. DA SILVA. My purpose is not to burden the record. My purpose is to achieve the kind of objectivity which was originally statedto the press by this committee.
Mr. WOOD. Proceed with the questions.
Mr. DA SILVA. I don't follow you. Did you say my statement wasnot to be read?TAVENNER.114COMMUNISMIN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY
Mr. WooD. Yes, sir.
Mr. D.\ Sisv\. It is not to be read.
Mr. T.AVEN.NER. My question was, Will you please furnish the committee a brief statement of your educational background?M r. DA SILVA. At this point, may I object to being called to testifyagainst myself in this hearing. I object because the first and fifthamendments and all of the Bill of Rights protect me from any inquisitorial procedure, and I may not be compelled to cooperate with thiscommittee in producing evidence designed to incriminate me and todrive me from my profession as an actor. The historicalMr. WOOD. Would an answer to that question incriminate you?You were asked to furnish a statement of your educational background. Would a true answer to that question incriminate you? Ifso, you have a right to protect yourself.
Mr. DA SILVA. You want me to make this objection at a time whenI think an answer to the question will incriminate me?
Mr. WOOD. If a true answer to any question asked you by counselor any member of this committee would tend to incriminate you andyou so swear, you have a right to claim it, as I understand the law.
Mr. MARGOLIS. It is our position that this witness is in the sameposition as a defendant, and I think he should be allowed to completethis objection.
Mr. NWOOD. ITe is not a defendant here. He is a witness.
Mr. MARGOLIS. It is our contention that he is and will suffer theconsequences and pains in many respects.
Mr. WOOD. He will suffer the consequences of testifying falsely, ifhe does so. If he refuses to answer without valid ground, he is subjecting himself, as you well know, to a proceeding for contempt ofCongress. It is a matter you can advise him about. You have thatprivilege any time you want.
Mr. TAVENNER. Now, will you answer the question, please?
Mr. DA SILVA. I attended the public schools of New York City;Bronx High School; and for a term, City College of New York.
Mr. TAVENNER. WVlen did you spend a term in City College of NewYork?
Mr. DA SnILA. I was born in 1909. I was about 17. That wouldmake it about 1926.I also attended Carnegie Tech in Pittsburgh for a short semester,working through college by working in the Jones & Laughlin steelmill.

Mr. DA SILVA. My present address is 936 North Stanley Avenue,Hollywood 46, Calif.

Mr. DA SILVA. My present occupation is acting.
Mr. TAVENNER. Have you ever held the position of vice presidentof the Civil Rights Congress, that is, the New York chapter of theCivil Rights Congress?
Mr. DA SILVA. Mr. Chairman, it is very clearly the object of thiscommittee to tie me in with organizations which are in its disfavor,and therefore I object, and now I will tell you my objection.
Mr. WooD. We are not interested in your objection. We are interested in knowing whether you will answer the question.COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY115
Mr. DA SILVA. I refuse to answer the question on the followingbasis: The first and fifth amendments and all of the Bill of Rightsprotect me from any inquisitorial procedure, and I may not be compelled to cooperate with this committee in producing evidence designedto incriminate me and to drive me from my profession as an actor.The historical origin of the fifth amendment is founded in the resistance of the people to attempts to prosecute and persecute individuals because ofMr. WooD. Will you please wait a moment ? Please ascribe to thecommittee the intelligence to determine these questions for itself, anddon't argue about it.
Mr. DA SILVA. I don't care to argue about it, but I wish to clarifymy position.
Mr. WOOD. You need not teach this committee a class in law.
Mr. DA SILVA. It is not my position. It is my position to upholdthe law and to make sure the committee does.
Mr. WOOD. If you say you decline to answer for the reasons given,it will be understood.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you refuse to answer the question ?
Mr. DA SILVA. I refuse to answer the question on the basis of mystatement here, on the basis that my answer might, according to thestandards of this committee, tend to incriminate me.
Mr. TAVENNER. When did you go to the State of California foremployment, how long ago ?
Mr. DA SILVA. I think for the first time in 1939, when I appearedin Abe Lincoln in Illinois.
Mr. TAVENNER. Prior to 1939 how were you employed and where ?
Mr. DA SILVA. I was an actor on Broadway.
Mr. TAVENNER. Over what length of time were you an actor onBroadway?
Mr. DA SILVA. I served my apprenticeship in 1929 with the CivicRepertory Theater, so from 1929 to 1939 I served as an actor onBroadway.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you connected at any time with the FederalTheater project in New York?
Mr. DA SILVA. Yes, I was and I was very proud to be. That wasthe advent of a magnificent period, and I think some of the greatestwork that ever came out came out at that time; truly a people's theater.
Mr. TAVENNER. How large an organization was it?
Mr. DA SILVA. In the Federal Theater?
Mr. TAVENNER.Yes.
Mr. DA SILVA. I think it is a matter of record, but there were manyhundreds of actors in the Federal Theater all over the country. Theaudience was many millions of Americans, who for 55 cents could seeplays they had never seen before and would not have had an opportunity to see otherwise.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was it privately financed, or Government financed
Mr. DA SILVA. It is a part of the public record that it was Government financed.
Mr. TAVENNER. At that time, while you were a member of it, wereyou a member of the Communist Party ?81595--51-pt. 1-5116COMMUNISMIN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY
Mr. DA SILVA. Mr. Chairman, it seems to me that the most vital con-cern of this committee is to really control every concept of free thoughtthroughout the country, to do it by attacking Hollywood, andMr. WOOD. This committee is not interested in your opinion. Doyou decline to answer the question, or will you answer it ?
Mr. DA SILVA. It is necessary that I answer it in my own way. Itseems vital to say that the object of this committee is a smoke screen.Nobody, either in Washington or Hollywood, thinks there is a group inHollywood dedicated to overthrow southern California by force andviolence.
Mr. WooD. You were asked a very simple question, whether at thetime you were a member of the organization you were asked about,you were a member of the Communist Party.
Mr. DA SILVA. Because the very clear intention of this committeeis to tie me in with an organization in its disfavor, I refuse to answerthe question for the reasons previously stated.
Mr. WooD. Let it be understood this committee is not trying totie you in anywhere. We are endeavoring to find where you tiedyourself.
Mr. DA SILVA. I have a function as a citizen, but I think in thisperiod of war hysteria it is the purpose of this committee to pull thewool over the eyes of the people.
Mr. WooD. The committee is not interested in your opinions. Weare anxious to get the facts.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you attempt to recruit persons into the Communist Party from the Federal Theater project while you were a member of the Federal Theater project ?
Mr. DA SILVA. I decline to answer that question for the same reasons previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. After going to Hollywood, did you become affiliatedwith the Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee there?
Mr. DA SILVA. Mr. Chairman, there is a rumor that those who havebeen anti-German in the last war will be brought before this committee. I must decline to answer the question for reasons previouslygiven.
Mr. KEARNEY. Mr. Chairman, cannot the witness be made to answer"Yes" or "No" or to decline to answer on the grounds he might incriminate himself, without going into a speech.
Mr. WooD. It would certainly be appreciated by the committee ifhe would not air his views and would answer the questions moredirectly.
Mr. TAVENNER. Have you been affiliated with the Actors' Laboratoryin Hollywood?
Mr. DA SILvA. Once again, because it is the purpose of this com-mittee to link me with an organization it considers unfavorable, Idecline to answer this question on grounds previously stated.
Mr. WooD. Any further comment by you as to the object of thiscommittee will be ignored by the reporter.
Mr. DA SILVA. I didn't hear you, sir.
Mr. WOOD. From now on I order stricken from the record any com-ment by you as to the object of this committee.
Mr. DA SILVA. They seem to me a propos, sir.
Mr. WooD. I will permit it to remain so far, but I will not permityou to continue to repeat that.COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY117
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you sign a statement which appeared in theDaily Worker of February 28, 1949, which defended the 12 CommunistParty leaders who were convicted of conspiracy to overthrow theGovernment of the United States by force and violence?
Mr. DA SILVA. I decline to answer for reasons previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you register as a member of the CommunistParty in 1944 and in 1945 ?
Mr. DA SILVA. I decline to answer this question for the reasonspreviously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you married when you went to California, Ibelieve you said in 1938 or 1939? When did you go to California;what was the date ?
Mr. DA SILVA. I don't recall the specific date that I went to Cali-fornia; but is the matter of my marriage or my personal relationspertinent to this inquiry ?
Mr. TAVENNER. It certainly is.
Mr. DA SILVA. In what respects, may I ask?
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you married while you were in California,and was your wife's name Evelyn?
Mr. DA SILVA. I still don't understand in what respect this questionis pertinent to the inquiry of this committee.
Mr. WooD. Do you think an answer to that would incriminate you?
Mr. DA SILVA. I should think I would be entitled to find out if itwas pertinent or not.
Mr. WooD. You have competent counsel, I assume.In fact, I knowyou have.
Mr. KENNY. Thank you.
Mr. WOOD. Just advise your client.
Mr. KENNY. I have advised him that the protection of Jonesagainst SEC-
Mr. WooD. Please advise your client.
Mr. KENNY. He has asked the committee to state wherein this ques-tion is pertinent to the inquiry.
Mr. WOOD. It is a matter of your advising your client and lettinghim make up his own mind as to what course he wants to take.
Mr. DA SILVA. Apparently any answer which I make has to bespecifically pertinent, is that correct ? In other words, I can't answerthe question in my own way.I will answer that question. I think I was divorced from my firstwife when I went to California in 1939. I believe that to be the fact.To the best of my knowledge I think that is true.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you know whether she is now living in Norfolk,Va.
Mr. DA SILVA. No. I don't know anything about her. I haven'tbeen in communication with her for a long time.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you know whether she has since remarried?
Mr. DA SILVA. I have heard somewhere that she was remarried;yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. Would you know her husband's name if I mentioned it?
Mr. DA SILVA. I don't think I could say what her husband's name is.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was she engaged in any Communist Party activi-ties at any time prior to your divorce or since, to your knowledge ?118COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY
Mr. DA SILVA. I have many relations, and the activity which theyhave engaged in I have in no way made my concern, but I can tell youonce again it obviously is your purpose to tie me in with any activityof hers and through us both with associations which are in your disfavor. I must decline to answer this question for the same reasonspreviously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. You declined to answer the question as to whetheror not you were a member of the Communist Party when you were inNew York between 1936 and approximately 1938. Have you beena member of the Communist Party since then, and are you a memberof the Communist Party now ?
Mr. DA SILVA. I decline to answer this question on the groundspreviously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. You appear here in response to a subpena whichwas served on you on February 24 by James A. Andrews, investigatorfor this committee ?
Mr. DA SILVA. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. I have no further questions, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. WOOD. Mr. Potter.
Mr. POTTER. Mr. Da Silva, you in your statement said you felt thatyou were a loyal American; is that true?
Mr. DA SILVA. You mean in my statement?
Mr. POTTER. Yes. I believe in your statement you made some reference to loyal Americans and you included yourself as being a loyalAmerican; is that true ?
Mr. DA SILVA. Mr. Chairman, my specific statement, which hasnot been returned to me and which is here, says specifically that mylove for this country is deep enough for me to be able to distinguishbetween its people and its policies of the moment. I will alwaysidentify myself with the interests of the American people, but I willsupport or oppose my Government's policies to the extent that I understand them to serve or harm the people of the country.
Mr. POTrER. Then you feel that our Government's policies today youcannot support?
Mr. DA SILVA. Mr. Chairman, I think the overwhelming majority ofpeople in this country areMr. POTTER. That is a simple answer.
Mr. DA SILVA. This is a simple answer which I must answer in myown simple way. I feelMr. WOOD. Make it brief.
Mr. DA SILvA. Are you about to time me? I feel it is very essential I make this statement.
Mr. WOOD. Please. Let us get along with the hearing. You wereasked simple questions, whether or not you could support and feel likeyou can support the policies of the Government of the United States.That is a question you can answer very simply, without giving us alecture here on the subject.
Mr. DA SILVA. Mr. ChairmanMr. WooD. Do you or don't you?
Mr. DA SILVA. My opinions are my own. My opinions belong tome. My opinions, present, past, and future, belong to me.
Mr. PTrrER. Then you refuse to answer?
Mr. DA SrLVA. Your question again is what?COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE119INDUSTRY
Mr. POTTER. Do you feel that you can support the policies of ourGovernment at this time, or do you support the policies of our Government at this time?
Mr. DA SILVA. Which specific policies, Mr. Chairman?
Mr. POTTER. For example, if the Soviet Union should attack theUnited States will you support and would you bear arms for theUnited States ?
Mr. DA SILVA. Mr. Chairman, the prime issue of the day is peace,not ways of waging war. Your obvious intent once again is to tieme with organizations that you consider subversive.Any word"peace" today is considered subversive by this committee and by thosewho prefer war to peace.I decline to answer this question on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. POTTER. If the witness could confine his acting to Hollywood1 am sure the committee would progress much faster.
Mr. DA SILVA. Is it the committee's object here to uphold the law ?It is the committee which is seeking publicity.
Mr. POTTER. I have no further questions, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. WOOD. Mr. Jackson?
Mr. JACKSON. No questions.
Mr. KEARNEY. Are you in favor of the Communist-inspired peacemarches on Washington?
Mr. DA SILVA. Mr. Kearney, my opinions on peace have been many,and I have made them over a period of many years.
Mr. KEARNEY. No further questions.
Mr. DA SILVA. But today, when the purpose is to link the word"peace" and the word "subversive" all over America, I refuse to answerthis question.on the basis previously stated.
Mr. WooD. Mr. Velde?
Mr. VELDE. Do you think this is a legally organized committee ofCongress ?
Mr. DA SILVA. A legally organized committee of Congress?
Mr. VELDE. Yes.
Mr. DA SILVA. I think its actions have been decidedly illegal.Ithink its actions have been for the specific purpose of pulling woolover Americans' eyes.
Mr. VELDE. Do you think the Congress has a right to inquire intosubversive activities in the United States of America ?
Mr. DA SILVA. I think that Congress has many rights.of its rights are the freedom to wage war today.The least
Mr. VELDE. I would appreciate a specific answer.
Mr. DA SILVA. Would you voice your question again?
Mr. VELDE. Do you believe that the Congress has a right to inquireinto subversive and disloyal activities in the United States?
Mr. DA SIVA. Well, this is obviously what this committee is doingat present.
Mr. VELDE. Do you believe that we have that right?
Mr. DA SILVA. I think that the overwhelming majority of theAmerican people want peace and don't want to drop an atom bomb.I think that is the most pressing issue of the day. I think that anyattempt to investigate so-called subversive organizations is an attemptto pull wool over the American people's eyes, the old Army game, tosay, "Look what is happening there, and meanwhile we pick yourpockets and drop atom bombs."That is the real function.120COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY
Mr. VELDE. I think you are not answering the question.
Mr. DA SILVA. I am answering the question as specifically as I can.It has been said before. This is part of the same thing. I heard Mr.Walter say it sounds like the Daily Worker. I recognize that everystatement made which is on peace or on any issue that you find in yourdisfavor is called an issue that sounds like the Daily Worker or anissue that is subversive or an issue that is questionable. To me thequestion of peace today is not a subversive issue.
Mr. WOOD. Mr. Frazier.
Mr. FRAZIER. NO questions.
Mr. DOYLE. I think in view of this witness' statement that thiscommittee is not interested in peace that I want to challenge that statement. I challenge it publicly and say to this witness that this committee is interested in peace, and I as a member of this committee aminterested in peace. But I am not interested in protecting Communistsor subversives in connection with their alleged peace program. I wantthis witness to know that I as an American very much resent his statement to this committee that this committee is not interested in peace,because we are, Mr. Da Silva.
Mr. DA SILVA. Mr. Doyle, you are from California. What programof peace are you in favor of? What kind of peace do you want, Mr.Doyle ?
Mr. KEARNEY. Will the gentleman from California yield to me?
Mr. DOYLE. I do.
Mr. KEARNEY. I will say the gentleman from California is not infavor of the Communists' plans for peace.
Mr. DA SILVA. Would you tell me what plans for peace you are infavor of in this country ?
Mr. KEARNEY. Yes, I could, but not here, because you have mademany a speech here and you are not going to make any more as far as Iam concerned.
Mr. DA SILVA. I see.
Mr. WooD. Any further questions, Mr. Doyle ?
Mr. DOYLE. NO, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. WooD. Mr. Walter, any further questions?
Mr. WALTER. No.
Mr. WooD. Any further questions by counsel?
Mr. TAVENNER. One further question, if you please. The DailyWorker dated July 8,1937, at page 5, announced that Howard Da Silvawould be a member of the cast of a play to be presented at the seventyfifth birthday celebration of Mother Bloor. Did you take part in thatcelebration ?
Mr. DA SILVA. Your purpose is very clearly indicated, to link mewith organizations or people that you find in disfavor. I decline toanswer this question for the reasons previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you know Will Geer ?
Mr. DA SILVA. Will Geer? He is a fine actor. I have known himfor years.

Mr. WOOD. The answer of the witness is that he declines to answerfor the reasons stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. I have no further questions.
Mr. WOOD. Very well.
Mr. MARGOLIS. We would like to have this made a part of the record.This is merely a request that this objection which this witness startedto read and which the committee did not permit him to complete bemade a part of the record, so that it may be clear as to what groundshe stands on in refusing to answer these questions.
Mr. WOOD. I have no objection to that.(The statement referred to was filed in the records of the committee.)
Mr. WooD. That will be all.
Mr. TAVENNER. Miss Gale Sondergaard.
Mr. WooD. Will you be sworn.TESTIMONY OF EDITH HOLM (GALE) SONDERGAARD, ACCOMPANIED BY ROBERT W. KENNY AND BEN MARGOLIS, ASCOUNSEL
Mr. WOOD. Do you solemnly swear the evidence you give this committee shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth,so help you God ?Miss SONDERGAARD. I do.
Mr. KENNY. For the record, the same objection to the witness beingcalled at all which was made at the outset of the witness Da Silva isrepeated in behalf of Miss Sondergaard at this time.
Mr. WooD. It will be included in the record.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you please state your full name?Miss SONDERGAARD. My name is known professionally as Gale Son-dergaard. I was born Edith Holm Sondergaard in Litchfield, Minn.
Mr. Chairman, I wonder if I might be allowed to read a statement.I find it difficult to express myself, and I have worked this up.
Mr. WOOD. Not until you have been examined. If you have a state-ment you want to file with the committee for the record after you haveanswered the questions that are asked you, you can leave it with thereporter.
Mr. TAVENNER. You are an actress by profession, I believe.Miss SONDERGAARD. I am an actress by profession.
Mr. TAVENNER. What is your married name?Miss SONDERGAARD. My married name is Mrs. Herbert Biberman.
Mr. WOOD. You are represented by the same counsel that represented the previous witness. We will dispense with the necessityof further indentifying yourselves.
Mr. TAVENNER. I believe you are here in response to a subpena asserved on you on March 21, 1951, are you not?Miss SONDERGAARD. That's true.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you please relate to the committee briefly youreducational background?Miss SONDERGAARD. Yes. I went to high school in Minneapolis,Minn. I graduated from the University of Minnesota. I attendedthe Minneapolis School of Dramatic Art.122COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you give the committee a brief resume of youremployment background ?Miss SONDERGAARD. Yes. I began on a touring Shakespearean company. As a matter of fact, I began acting when I was still in college,during the summers. Then I would go back to school. Then I wenton a Shakespearean tour. I worked with Jessie Bonstelle in Detroitfor 2 years as her second lady and then her leading lady. I workedwith the Theater Guild for a number of years as one of their actingcompany. I worked in many Broadway plays. I went to Hollywoodand I have been there for the past 6 years.
Mr. TAVENNER. What guilds or associations have you been identified with in Hollywood?MissSONDERGAARD.Guilds or associations?
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes.Miss SONDERGAARD. Would you be a little more specific on that question, because I think the two names mean two different things.
Mr. TAVENNER. What organizations have you belonged to in Hollywood?Miss SONDERGAARD. Mr. Chairman, before I came here I followeda great deal of the testimony of this committee, and I have read along, long list of organizations which you on the committee and whichother committees of our Government have branded as subversive organizations. I have a feeling if you will ask me what organizationsI belonged to that you probably would like me to tie myself intoone of these, and there I must refuse to answer this question on thegrounds of the fifth amendment, that it might tend to incriminateme.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you a member of the Screen Actors' Guild ?Miss SONDERGAARD. I am a member of the Screen Actors' Guild.All actors must belong to the'Screen Actors' Guild. It is a tradeunion.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are there to your knowledge members of the Communist Party in that guild?Miss SONDERGAARD. Mr. Chairman, I don't know anything aboutpersonnel of our guild. I know that we are all trade-union people.We belong together because we are professional workers in the motionpicture industry.
Mr. WOOD. You were asked if to your knowledge there were anymembers of the Communist Party that were members of this guildsince you belong to it.Miss SONDERGAARD. Mr. Chairman, obviously that question is designed to involve me, to incriminate me. I shall have to refuse to ans.wer that question on the basis previously stated.
Mr. WOOD. Do you so refuse?Miss SONDERGAARD. What was that? Do I refuse? For the reasons previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Have you observed during the course of your membership in that guild an organization on behalf or on the part of theCommunists to dominate or to advance the Communist Party within that organization?Miss SONDERGAARD. Mr. Prosecutor, I know that there are a greatmany peopleMr. WOOD. Just answer the question.COMMUNISM INMOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY123Miss SONDERGAARD. I must refuse to answer that question on thegrounds previously stated.
Mr. WooD. Do you refuse to answer ?Miss SONDERGAARD. I said I did refuse.
Mr. WooD. You'must say you refuse to answer.Miss SONDERGAARD. I am sorry. I didn't hear you.
Mr. WOOD. When you say you must refuse to answer, it isn't ananswer. The question is: Do you answer ?Miss SONDERGAARD. I am sorry. I do mean that.
Mr. WOOD. For the reasons that you have given ?Miss SONDERGAARD. For the reasons previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you familiar with an organization called theNational Council of American-Soviet Friendship ?Miss SONDERGAARD. Mr. Chairman, again I must refer to your longlist of organizations and refuse to answer that question on the basispreviously stated. May I say something while we are waiting hereabout this business of suddenly branding every progressive and everyprogressive organization in our country, organizations which havedone wonderful and fine work in the past, branding them as subversive ? This I find very shocking and very saddening.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you a member of the Communist Party at thistime or have you ever been a member of the Communist Party ?Miss SONDERGAARD. I refuse to answer that question for the reasonspreviously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Miss Sondergaard, the committee is in possession ofinformation which discloses that on December 1, 1944, you were registered as a Communist, and your card bore the number 47328 for theyear 1945; that is, the card bore that number for the year 1945. Doyou wish to deny or affirm that information or explain it?Miss SONDERGAARD. I refuse to answer the question on the groundspreviously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you making a distinction in your own mindabout this business of suddenly branding every progressive and everybecause those terms are often used interchangeably ?Miss SONDERGAARD. I refused to answer that question on the termspreviously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was your Communist Party number in 1944 thenumber 46943?Miss SONDERGAARD. I refuse to answer that question for the reasonspreviously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. You are familiar, I assume, with an organizationcalled the Motion Picture Artists' Committee ?Miss SONDERGAARD. Mr. Chairman, I believe that is on the long,long list of what are now known as subversive organizations, and Irefuse to answer it for the reasons previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Have you been a sponsor at any time of the Leagueof Women Shoppers ?Miss SONDERGAARD. I refuse to answer that question for the reasonspreviously stated.
Mr. KEARNEY. I would like to ask the witness this question, and Ithink that it calls for a "Yes" or "No" answer.124COMMUNISMIN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRYDo you believe a committee of Congress should investigate subversive activities or the security of our country?Miss SONDERGAARD. Mr. Congressman, I do believe that a committeeof Congress could and should do investigating work, but I do feel thatthis committee at this time is doing incriminating work much morethan investigating work, and that is the reason I wish to object.
Mr. KEARNEY. YOU wouldn't like to go over some of our files, wouldyou?
Mr. TAVENNER. Miss Sondergaard, the records of the committeedisclose that you served as a sponsor of the Cultural and ScientificCongress for World Peace which was held in the Waldorf-AstoriaHotel in New York City, March 25 to 27, 1949, under the auspices ofthe National Council of Arts, Sciences, and Professions. Is thatcorrect?Miss SONDERGAARD. It is a very odd thing that whenever the word"peace" comes up people begin to tremble. I must refuse to answerthat question for the reasons previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. The Daily Worker of June 23, 1950, states thatyou were scheduled to speak at the rally on June 28, 1950, in MadisonSquare Garden under the auspices of the Civil Rights Congress. OnJune 29, 1950, the newspaper stated that rally was staged in behalf ofthe 11 national Communist Party leaders who had been convicted ofconspiracy to advocate the overthrow of the Government by force andviolence, as well as in behalf of Eugene Dennis, Communist Partynational secretary, who was jailed for contempt of Congress.Other speakers on the program, according to the newspaper account,were identified as Gus Hall, who was one of the 11 convicted Communist Party leaders; the avowed Communist, Ben Gold; Paul Robeson,Vito Marcantonio, Ring Lardner, Jr., and Earl Coward.I would like to ask you to tell us all you know about the selectionof the speakers on that occasion and your participation in the program,if you will.Miss SONDERGAARD. IS that a question ?
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes.That is a request for you to give us that in-formation.MissSONDERGAARD.There are many things I would like to say inregard to a thing like this, but because you have already branded thiskind of a meeting, this kind of an organization, I refuse to answerfor the reasons previously stated. I wonder if I could interpolatehere the fact that I am the wife of Herbert Biberman, as you askedme before. Herbert Biberman was one of the Hollywood 10 who hasvery recently come out of prison for defending the first amendmentbefore this committee. In my statement I have said that in 1937may I go on ?
Mr. WOOD. No.Miss SONDERGAARD. No ?I just wanted that in the record.
Mr. WOOD. Any further questions?
Mr. TAVENNER. I have no further questions, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. WOOD. Mr. Frazier?
Mr. FRAZIER. No questions.COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY125
Mr. MARGOLIS. May we also file with the committee a more com-plete statement of the objection or the basis for the refusal to answerthese questions, in order that it may be a part of this record ?
Mr. WooD. If you have the paper, you may file it with the com-mittee.(The statement referred to was filed with the records of the committee.)
Mr. WOOD. The committee will resolve itself into executive sessionat this point. There will be no further open hearing this afternoon.(Whereupon, at 4 p. m., the committee met in executive session.)COMMUNIST INFILTRATION OF HOLLYWOOD MOTIONPICTURE INDUSTRY-PART 1TUESDAY,APRIL 10, 1951UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,COMMITTEE ON UN-AMERICAN ACTIVITIES,Washington, D.

Mr. HAYDEN. I do.
Mr. ~VOOD. Have a seat.TESTIMONY OF STERLING HAYDEN
Mr. TAVENNER. You are Mr. Sterling Hayden ?
Mr. HAYDEN. Yes, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. When and where were you born, Mr. Hayden ?
Mr. HAYDEN. March 26, 1916, Montclair, N. J.
Mr. TAVENNER. What is your present place of residence?
Mr. HAYDEN. 10731 Sunset Boulevard, Los Angeles 24.
Mr. TAVENNER. What is your present occupation?
Mr. HAYDEX. Actor.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you please state for the committee your educa-tional background, just briefly?
Mr. HAYDEN. Well, I went to public schools in Montclair, N. J.,up until the time I was 10 years old. After that we started movingaround, and I finished about half of my second year high school atvarious places in New England, and then quit and went to sea.
Mr. TAVENNER. How old were you when you went to sea ?
Mr. HAYDEN. Fifteen.
Mr.TAVENNER.Fifteen?
Mr. HAYDEN. Yes, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. What do you mean, you "went to sea"
Mr. HAYDEN. Well, I simply left home and started working onships, and worked 7 years sailing vessels, fishing boats, and so forth.
Mr. TAVENNER. You followed that occupation for 7 years?
Mr. HAYDEN. Yes. That was my trade.
Mr. TAVENNER. During that period of time did you become masterof a ship?
Mr. HAYDEN. When I was 21 I finally got a master's license andtook command of a ship and started making long voyages.
Mr. TA ENNER. During that period of time did you become ac-quainted with a Capt. Warwick Tompkins ?
Mr. HAYDEN. Yes. I met him when I was 14, in Boston, Mass. Hehad a schooner and I wanted to go to work on it, but he said I was tooyoung. I never got to know him too well personally at that time.
Mr. TAVENNER. After the completion of your experiences at sea,when you became ship master, what calling did you follow ?
Mr. HAYDEN. Another fellow and I tried to operate a schooner. Wedidn't have much success. We lost the ship, finally. I was broke andin New York, and through accident I met a producer with Paramountand made a test and got a contract May 1, 1940, as an actor.
Mr. TAVENNER. And how long did you follow that occupation?
Mr. HAYDEN. Well, ever since, except for the war years. I leftHollywood in the fall of 1941 and returned to Hollywood under contract in the spring of 1946, so I was away for 5 years.
Mr. TAVENNER. Then you were in Hollywood under your first contract between 1940 and 1941?
Mr. HAYDEN. Yes, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you tell the committee how you obtained yourfirst contract with Paramount?
Mr. HAYDEN. Well, I was pretty much of a fluke. I had nevergiven a thought to going into the acting profession, but the seafaringCOMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE129INDUSTRYthing was washed up, and I simply met a correspondent in Bostonwho knew a producer, and he told the producer about me, and he contacted me in New York and made a test, a very bad test, but it got mea contract with Paramount and I went to work as an actor.
Mr. TAVENNER. While you were on the west coast serving under thisfirst contract, was Capt. Warwick Tompkins on the west coast also ?
Mr. HAYDEN. Yes. He had at that time, I believe in 1938 or 1937,he had shifted his base of operations from Boston to San Francisco,therefore he was in San Francisco in 1940 when I first got out there.I felt kind of lost in Hollywood, not really being an actor by inclination, and one time when I was feeling particularly low I decidedto pay him a visit. I went to San Francisco and saw him. He at thattime, or previously, had become, I believe, an open and avowed Communist. He made no bones about it. He talked about very little else,and he started to deluge me with propaganda.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you a Communist at that time?
Mr. HAYDEN. No. It had never entered my head.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you recall meeting any other persons at thattime who you either knew then or have found out since were membersof the Communist Party, through your connections with CaptainTompkins?
Mr. HAYDEN. On one of those visits, I believe probably that it wasin 1941, while he was in San Francisco living on his ship, he said hewanted to introduce me to what he called, and I quote, "an old warrierin the class struggle," "Pop" Folkoff. I met him at a luncheon.Ithought he was a retired tailor at that time. What he was, I don'tknow to this day. Who else I may have met that.year, I don't remember too clearly.
Mr. TAVENNER. During your first contract in Hollywood, did youjoin any particular unions or groups
Mr. HAYDEN. I joined the Screen Actors' Guild, as every actor does.That was all.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was the way in which Captain Tompkinswent about consulting with you regarding communism?little more in detail about that.Tell us a
Mr. HAYDEN. All right, sir. If I may change the word, I wouldn'tsay he consulted with me. I think he recognized I was at a peculiarstage in my life. I was sort of betwixt and between. The sea hadalways been my calling. This was now denied me, or I had deniedmyself it. I was feeling restless and dissatisfied in Hollywood. Heused the device of talking and talking and asking why I didn't readmore. I had never thought in political terms at all. That was an-other world, which I am not particularly proud of today.
Mr. TAVENNER. As I understand, your work in Hollywood was interrupted by your service during the period of the war?
Mr. HAYDEN. That it was.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you tell us the circumstances under which youleft Hollywood ?
Mr. HAYDEN. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. But before doing that, have you been engaged in theproduction of any particular movies prior to your leaving Hollywood ?
Mr. HAYDEN. Yes. I made two pictures. I had only been in Holly-wood 2 weeks when I was cast in second lead in Virginia, and a shortwhile later in Bahama Passage.130COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRYAll during the summer of 1941 I was churning inside, thinkingabout the war. I would like to claim, but I can't claim, I knew thiscountry was in danger, but I knew something was going on, and Iwanted to get in it.In August 1941-I have the date here so I can give it to you exactly-it was September 15, 1941, I went to the heads of Paramountand said I would like to break my contract and leave for an indefinitelength of time. They wanted to know why. I didn't know what totell them. I said I didn't want to act, I didn't know what I wanted todo, I just wanted to leave. So I did leave. I went east.I contacted Colonel Donovan, who was then Coordinator of Information. I knew him through his son, who had sailed around theworld with me in a schooner. He said he was setting up an organization in which men would be needed to train American troops, or volunteers, because this was prior to Pearl Harbor, in guerrilla warfare,and one of the men thought it a good idea to go to England or Scotland.I went to Scotland and trained with the Argyl and SoutherlandHighlanders 3 months, went to England, went to a parachute school,broke my ankle on the sixth jump, and came back to the United States.I was unable to continue with the training because of my brokenankle, and I did not want to be placed in some administrative capacity,so I went to the Elco Boat Works in Bayonne, N. J., and worked withtest crews.Then I was offered a commission as ensign in the Navy, which Ideclined because I thought I should have a higher rank, since I hadbeen master of ships. I thought I could operate a schooner to theWest Indies, because of the shortage of cargo vessels.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was that during the period when the waters in thatarea were infested with German submarines?
Mr. HAYDEN. I think there were quite a few down there, yes. SoI went to the west coast, bought a half interest in a schooner, andhauled freight for the War Shipping Administration through thelate summer and fall of 1942. This was rather a lucrative thing, really.
Mr. TAVENNER. How lucrative was it?
Mr. HAYDEN. If things went smoothly and efficiently, without anytrouble, which was not all of the time, we stood to gross between$8,000 and $11,000 per voyage. We were taking detonators and explosives, the theory being it was better to put them on a small vessel,so if it was lost it wouldn't make much difference, rather than putthem with the cargo on a large ship.In October of that year I met with a bunch of marines in the WestIndies, and it entered my head to enlist. I sold the schooner, went toNew York, enlisted, and went to Parris Island. That started anotherphase. Shall I continue?
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes, I would like a full statement of your record.
Mr. HAYDEN. I went through boot camp at Parris Island. At thattime two men were selected out of each company for OSS at Quantico.I changed my name to John Hamilton. I changed it because I wantedto get away from Hollywood as much as possible. When I was in bootcamp there seemed to be a good deal of curiosity about Hollywood. Ichanged my name. I was commissioned as second lieutenant. I wentback to OSS. I don't know the exact date that the Coordinator ofInformation became OSS.COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY131The OSS shipped us first to Cairo. We were supposed to go toGreece, but we were shipped to Bari Italy. I went to Bari, and thenbegan a long term of duty with the Yugoslav partisans there.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was the general character of your work withPartisans of Yugoslavia?
Mr. HAYDEN. It varied a good deal.They claimed they wantedsupplies. The first assignment I had, the first day I arrived in Bari,was to coordinate the handling of a fleet of 28 or 30 schooners. Twoweeks later I was placed in charge of the port at Monopoli, Italy.Webuilt up the staff and operated these schooners across the Adriatic.I don't remember the exact dates, but we would frequently go off onreconnaissance expeditions along the coast, along the mainland, tryingto get new routes. We got up to Trieste on one trip.Along about the middle of springMr. TAVENNER. Let me interrupt a minute. Will you go back andtry to fix the date when you began your assignment at Bari and tookover control of the port of Monopoli?
Mr. HAYDEN. I would say that was the 1st of December, the firstweek in December, let me say.
Mr. TAVENNER. Of what year?
Mr. HAYDEN. 1942.
Mr. TAVENNER. And then try, as nearly as you can, to coordinatethe narrative with dates.
Mr. HAYDEN. All right, sir. I would say we were in Monopoli 6weeks to 2 months, and during that period of time I made 2 or 3reconnaissance expeditions over into Yugoslavia.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was the purpose of those ?
Mr. HAYDEN. To find a more efficient route of supplies to the Parti-san forces in the interior, to get the supplies through the Germanblockade to the forces fighting in the mountains.
Mr. TAVENNER. That means you had to pass a German sea blockadeas well as a land blockade ?
Mr. HAYDEN. Yes, it did.
Mr. TAVENNER. And your work was behind the German lines ?
Mr. HAYDEN. Yes, it was, particularly later on when we were work-ing in the interior. At that. time we were operating along the periphery of the coast; more or less.Before I got in the work on the interior, I was put in command, toldto take a small fishing boat and operate it across the Adriatic. Wecould carry 5 to 6 tons of supplies, medical and other supplies, intoAlbania, islands off the Greek coast, and Yugoslavia. I think we made18 or 20 trips before the E boats patrolling the coast really got wise towhat was going on, and it became unhealthy. That operation wasabandoned probably early in the summer of 1944.The next step seemed to be to supply them by air, so we were flown into various places in Bosnia, in Slovenia-I beg pardon. We nevercould get into Slovenia by air, so we were ordered to march into Slo-venia. We had guides and they would take us through swamps wherethere was no liaison, and we tried to lay out an airfield to bring supplies through.. Mr. TAVENNER. How long did you continue in your work with theunderground in Yugoslavia ?
Mr. HAYDEN. Until late in November of that year, when I was senthome for a 30-day leave in the States.8 1 595-51-pt.1-6132COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY
Mr. TAVENNER. During the period when you operated with the underground in Yugoslavia, will you tell us just how close your relationship was with the leaders and the rank and file of that movement?
Mr. HAYDEN. Well, of course, being a very junior officer myself, Iwas a second lieutenant at that time, most of us were lieutenants, wedidn't actually come in contact on an operative level with the so-calledbrass. We established a tremendously close personal feeling withthese people. We had enormous, I would say unlimited, respect forthe way they were fighting. I think that respect was reciprocated. Wetried to do the best we could. We got quite steamed up by it. Imyself was steamed up considerably by it. I had never experiencedanything quite like that, and it made a tremendous impression onme. We knew they were Communist-led, we knew they had commissars, but there was very little discussion of that. We couldn't discussthose things very much because we didn't know the language.
Mr. TAVENNER. And you were fighting a common foe at that time?
Mr. HAYDEN. That we were, and I think we conducted ourselvesfairly well.
Mr. TAVENNER. You say your relationship with the Partisan movement had a deep effect upon you. What do you mean by that?
Mr. HAYDEN. Precisely this: As I have, I believe, mentioned, in1940, when I was still an actor, and in 1941, I had had conversationswith this man Tompkins. I wish I.could describe my first reaction,because I think it would be typical of the experience so many peoplehave had. I was appalled at the idea of what he was telling me about,but I did listen. He would give me literature, propaganda, and Iwould scan it briefly and burn it up.When this Yugoslavia thing came up, I wrote to him. I beganwriting, "Maybe you were not so wrong. These people are doinga magnificent job." I thought I had better figure this thing out.He, in turn, reciprocated by, I would say, bombarding me withCommunist literature-People's World, Daily Worker, New Masses,and others I can't remember. I was impressed by the fact that thereports of that thing printed in the United States in this literaturewere accurate as regards the Partisans in Yugoslavia. Apparentlythe people in the States knew this. This had an effect on me because it made me conscious of what these people knew that apparently the rest of us didn't know. That was about the size of itat that time.I engaged in quite a lot of correspondence with Tompkins at thattime. I was all steamed up. We all were. I can remember in theinterior of Yugoslavia when the crews of planes would leave theirshoes, anything they could spare, with the Partisans, they were thatimpressed, and I don't think a GI impresses too easily as a rule. Thishad a strong emotional impact on all of us.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you have political discussions with the Partisans or any groups of them ?
Mr. HAYDEN. NO. I would honestly say not at all; not at all.Once in a while when we were back in Italy we would sit around and afew at Bari headquarters would talk a little bit about what was goingon, but we never got very much involved in it. I remember a coupleof times when I would have a story in some of this literature Tompkins sent me, I would show it to them, and they were very pleased.COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY133There were no involved or detailed political discussions at all; notat all.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you tell the committee what the final resultand effect was upon you of the correspondence you were having withCaptain Tompkins and the experience that you were undergoing inYugoslavia in working with the underground ?
Mr. HAYDEN. The final effect?
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes.
Mr. HAYDEN. The net result?
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes.
Mr.HAYDEN.Well-
Mr. TAVENNER. Let us put it this way: What was the effect at thattime?
Mr. HAYDEN. At that time-I am glad you put it that way-therewas a sort of thing churning inside me that I didn't know how tohandle, but it seemed there was something in this world that I oughtto find out about. That was the net result of the whole thing.When I got home on leave in December 1944, one of the first thingsI wanted to do, on a purely emotional basis, was go back and seeTompkins and talk to him about this thing, which I did. I flew outto the coast and basked in the reflected glory of the Partisan movement.Tompkins sort of showed me off as an exhibit.
Mr. TAVENNER. Before leaving the Yugoslavian section of yourtestimony, were you recognized in any way by the Government ofYugoslavia or by the Partisans for your services in working withthe underground?
Mr. HAYDEN. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was it?
Mr. HAYDEN. I was given a decoration called the Order of Merit.I haven't picked it up yet, but I have the citation. I guess it is at theEmbassy. I don't know where it is. The medal itself, I don't knowwhere it is, but I have in my files the citation, the Order of Merit,which I think came for the same operation for which I got a SilverStar.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was that the second highest decoration that couldbe awarded to a person of a foreign country, foreign to Yugoslavia ?
Mr. HAYDEN. I am not sure of that. I have heard that it was, but Iam not sure at all.
Mr. TAVENNER. So you received a Silver Star as a decoration?
Mr. HAYDEN. Yes, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. And in addition to the other decoration which youmentioned ?
Mr. HAYDEN. Yes, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. On your return to the United States for your 30-dayleave, did you again see Capt. Warwick Tompkins?
Mr. HAYDEN. That was the first thing I did. I didn't know where Iwas going to be sent. The Yugoslav situation seemed to be more or lessunder control at that time. They had gotten the Partisans a great dealmore equipment and built them into some semblance of strength,so some of us were sent back to the States, and I was anxious to get inthe same kind of work somewhere else. I didn't know where, but Ihoped it would be possible to get into guerrilla outfits, because it is veryinteresting; it is stimulating; it is better than a lot of duty could be.134COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRYSo I contacted Tompkins. Subsequently, through him, I contactedpeople in New York who I thought would know about guerrilla outfits elsewhere, as they had had accurate dope about Yugoslavia.I flew out to San Francisco, met Tompkins, and for 5 or 6 daysI was on a merry-go-round. He took me around and I talked ad nauseam about Yugoslavia, but they were apparently interested. I meta great many people, some of whom may or may not have beenCommunists. Some I know now were. At that time I wasn't pay-ing too much attention to that.
Mr. TAVENNER. Let me ask you several questions in detail aboutthat. You were the guest of Captain Tompkins on your trip to thewest coast at that time ?
Mr. HAYDEN. Yes, I was.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you recall whether, on the day after your ar-rival there, you had dinner with three individuals, including CaptainTompkins, one of whom was Isaac Folkoff?
Mr. HAYDEN. I remember having dinner or lunch with this fellowcalled "Pop" Folkoff, yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you remember where that lunch was held?
Mr. HAYDEN. I do not.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was there some other person present at that lunch-eon with the three of you?
Mr. HAYDEN. I vaguely recall that there was, but I am not sure.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you recall his name?
Mr. HAYDEN. NO, sir, I do not.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you know a person by the name of Baroway ?
Mr. HAYDEN. I have heard the name.
Mr. TAVENNER. Leo Baroway?
Mr. HAYDEN. I have heard the name. You mean at that time, wasthis the man in question?
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes.
Mr. HAYDEN. I could not say.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you know whether or not Isaac Folkoff wasa functionary in the Communist Party at that time ?
Mr. HAYDEN. I do not. I had the idea that he was in some wayretired from the "struggle" at that time, as they put it, but from whatI have heard since, this is open to question.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you describe what else occurred on that-trip,.where you went and what you did while you were a guest ofTompkins'?
Mr. HAYDEN. Well, I wish I could remember everything.I canremember a few incidents, but I don't mean to convey the idea thatthis is all that happened. We were on the go all the time. We wentfrom place to place. Either at that time or on a subsequent visithe took me to the offices of the Daily People's World. I remembermeeting Bill Schneiderman and Harrison George. I don't rememberanyone else. We went to San Francisco and went aboard a Russianvessel and had a drink. It was all on a social basis.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you on that occasion meet a person by thename of Steve Nelson?
Mr. HAYDEN. I met Steve Nelson. I don't remember if I met himthen or after the war. I know I met him either in December of thatyear, 1944, or after the war .when I saw Tompkins again.COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY135
Mr. TAVENNER. In other words, it was either the latter part of1944 or the latter part of 1945 or early 1946 ?
Mr. HAYDEN. Or early 1946, yes, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. That you met Steve Nelson?
Mr. HAYDEN. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. Regardless of which may be the correct' date, w dlyou tell the committee the circumstances under which you met Nelson ?
Mr. HAYDEN. It was at a party, or rather a group get-together orgathering in someone's home in Oakland or in San Francisco oneevening. There were 10 or 15 people sitting around. Nelson wasone of them. I remember being introduced to him because he wassupposed to be an outstanding figure.
Mr. TAVENNER. An outstanding figure in what capacity?
Mr. HAYDEN. In their world.don't remember exactly what I wastold he had done that made him outstanding, but I remember Tompkins saying to me in the car, "Steve Nelson will be there. He is quitea guy," or something like that.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you know whether he was the organizer for theCommunist Party for Alameda County at that particular time ?
Mr. HAYDEN. I didn't knbw that.
Mr. TAVENNER. Can you recall in whose home you met Nelson?
Mr. HAYDEN. Usually it was at the home of Tompkins' brother-in-law, a doctor whose last name slips me this minute.of it.I can't think
Mr. TAVENNER. IS it Dr. Lyman?
Mr. HAYDEN. Dr. Lyman is right. Frequently when I was in SanFrancisco visiting Tompkins we would go see Tompkins' sister andbrother-in-law. *
Mr. TAVENNER. IS that Dr. Ellwobd W. Lyman?
Mr. HAYDEN. I know it is Ellwood.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you remember anything that took place at thatmeeting attended by Steve Nelson?
Mr. HAYDEN. I vaguely recall that they asked if I would say a fewwords about Yugoslavia, and I did. What I said was in the same veinas what I have said here today except at that time I was fresh from theplace and was talking on that basis, you might say.
Mr. TAVENNER. How long did you remain as the guest of CaptainTompkins?
Mr. HAYDEN. I think 5 or 6 days.
Mr. TAVENNER. Then you returned to the east coast?
Mr. HAYDEN. Then I returned to Washington, D. C.
Mr. TAVENNER. When you returned to Washington did you bringany Communist Party literature or documents with you ?
Mr. HAYDEN. I may have.I think every time I ever saw TompkinnI would end up with, if not an armful, at least a handful of pamphlet,so I probably had some with me that I was going to read in the planeor carry with me; I don't know.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you give the committee your best opinion asto the effect of this trip upon you, that is, the trip when you were theguest again of Tompkins?
Mr. HAYDEN. Well, I was at that time, I think, trying to look ahead,figure out what I wanted to do after the war. I didn't know if Iwanted to go back to Hollywood or not. I felt a sort of reluctance toaccepting what seemed to me to be the very lucrative and easy life136COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRYHollywood had offered me before and probably would again. I thinkthe main thing was, it planted a seed in me that said if I could dosomething about the conditions of the world I could probably justifymy position as an actor with a good salary and good working conditions. This wasn't concrete, but it was something boiling insideof me.
Mr. TAVENNER. What did you do when you went back to New York ?
Mr. HAYDEN. I remember I went back to OSS headquarters, and myfuture assignment had not been determined, and it seemed to me thatinasmuch as the Communist press had analyzed Tito accurately, theymight know of other guerrilla outfits such as the Partisans.Wrote or wired Tompkins asking who I could contact in New York,and he wired me to contact V. J. Jerome in New York. I picked upthe phone and called the Daily Worker office and I said, "This is Lt.John Hamilton, United States Marine Corps. I would like to talkto V. J. Jerome."There was some consternation at the other end of the line, and I wastold if I was in New York later to call again, which I did. Jeromesaid we could meet at the Golden Eagle Cafe on West Twelfth Streetjust off Fifth Avenue.I went in and sat at the bar. About half an hour later a manscuttled through the back room and I thought, "This must be Jerome."I looked at him. He looked at me. .1 walked up, introduced myself,and sat down. My purpose was to find out if he had any idea wherethere were other guerrilla movements going on. He wouldn't talk tome. I think he was suspcious. I got nowhere that day.I called and talked to a man named Joe North, whom he had mentioned to me. I went up and talked to him in this building that I guesswas headquarters for the whole caboodle. There was general con-versation.Nothing constructive came out of it whatsoever, as Irecall.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you also go see a person by the name of AllanChase, who is an avowed Communist, having been a candidate forCongress on the Communist ticket ?
Mr. HAYDEN. I met him. I think even prior to my trip to seeTompkins I had met him. I didn't know until you told me that hewas an open Communist. I didn't know he was a Communist. Ithought possibly he was. He was particularly interested in the situation in Spain. He talked about that angle of it, the fact there wasa movement there, the remnants of a movement in there, and I metfriends of his at his apartment near Central Park, and so forth and soon.As nearly as I can recall, I went back to Washington and talked tosomeone in OSS, and talked about the possibility of going to Spain.They said there were already men in Spain. They said I would besent to Paris. I went to Paris and was attached directly to the FirstArmy Headquarters.
Mr. TAVENNER. You referred to having met a number of AllanChase's friends.Was communism discussed with his friends ?
Mr. HAYDEN. No. Communism was never discussed.per se was never discussed to the best of my recollection.CommunismThere wasa discussion of the war going on and the role in it of the guerrillas.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you meet any other Communists while youwere in New York?COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE
Mr. HAYDEN. Not to my knowledge.INDUSTRY137The only two I met that Iconsidered Communists were V. J. Jerome and Joe North. I thoughtpossibly Chase was connected, but I didn't know.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you make any connection, or attempt to makeany connection, with the underground in Spain after you arrived inParis ?
Mr. HAYDEN. No. When I went overseas I had two or three lettersof introduction from friends of Chase to be used in case I got intoSpain. I don't remember what I did with these letters. As soon asI got to Paris I was told to get into a jeep and go to Belgium, which1 did, and I guess I threw the letters away or burned them; I don'tknow.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was the nature of your work in Belgium ?
Mr. HAYDEN. OSS detachment, G-2 headquarters. The work atthe detachment was in two levels: First, on an operational level, toinfiltrate German civilians or German prisoners who had indicateda desire to work with the Allies back through the lines; and the thingI became particularly active in was-Col. B. A. Dickson was anxiousto find out if there were any guerrilla anti-Nazi elements that wereliberated as we went along that we could contact. I had a team ofsix or eight men, American Army personnel, who spoke German. Weworked together quite closely, and went to Marburg, Germany, whichis where we were on VE-day. We didn't meet many anti-Nazis thatI remember.To follow chronologically, after VE-day I returned to Paris andwas told to take a photographic team, consisting initially of two orthree photographers, and make a photographic study of all the portsof northern Europe, including Germany, Denmark, and Norway,which we did. This occupied us for quite a long period of time. Wecovered almost all of Norway, all of Denmark, all of Germany, andat that time I was sent back to the States and discharged.
Mr. TAVENNER. During the time of your second assignment on theGerman front, what was your connection with Capt. Warwick Tompkins? Did you continue to obtain Communist literature and propagand.a from him ?
Mr. HAYDEN. I think I kept in touch with him. I think I keptwriting to him. I was still fired up by the Yugoslav thing and so on.I kept up a desultory correspondence with him, and I presume he.con-tinued to send me Communist newspapers and literature.remember, actually.I don't
Mr. TAVENNER. When was your assignment terminated ?
Mr. HAYDEN. Well, let's see. I was discharged the 24th of Decem-ber 1945. I think I returned to the States the end of November. Actually, I tried to find a record of that and couldn't.
Mr. TAVENNER. What did you do upon arriving in the UnitedStates?
Mr. HAYDEN. As soon as I was discharged I sort of cast about forsomething to do. At that time I remember there were two forces working inside me. One was to go back to sea; and the other was thispolitical thing. At that time, I would like to say-and this is accurateto the best of my recollection-it had never occurred to me to join theCommunist Party. It had never occurred to me. It seemed this whole13SCOMMUnNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRYthing had introduced me to a new world that up to that time I had neverknown.I tried to raise money to get a schooner. I couldn't raise the money.Then someone in Paramount contacted me to sign a new contract. Isaid, "0. K. Here we go."
Mr. TAVENNER. Who was that?MAr. HAYDEN. Russell Holman, of Paramount's New York office.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was that prior to your leaving the east coast forthe west coast .
Mr. HAYDEX. We made the deal in New York.I then went outto Nevada, where I got a divorce from my then wife, Madelaine Carroll, and then went to San Francisco and spent 6 weeks with Tompkins, and then reported to Paramount in Hollywood.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did Holman know of your past associations andconnection with Capt. Warwick Tompkins?
Mr. HAYDEN. I doubt that he did. He may have. I don't think hedid. I don't know. I am sure that everybody I saw at that time, Italked to them about this Yugoslav thing. What came out of theconversations, I don't know.
Mr. TAVENNER. At the time of your second employment by the moving-picture industry, did your employer have any knowledge, as faras you know, of your associations with other Communist functionsin California, such as William Schneiderman and Isaac Folkoff?
Mr. HAYDEN. NO. I think that was more or less lost in the shuffleof the war. There was so much going on, and I was fortunate enoughto come out of the war better, publicitywise or otherwise, and theyfelt I had done pretty well in the war and let it go at that. There wasno detailed analysis of what happened.
Mr. TAVENNER. As a result of your signing the contract in NewYork, you went to the west coast. At that time, did you see Capt.Warwick Tompkins again ?
Mr. HAYDEN. I saw him as soon as I left Nevada.I returned toHollywood by way of San Francisco and spent some time with himon his schooner there. I don't remember how long.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was the date ?
Mr. HAYDEN. I would say it was approximately the last week inMarch 1946.
Mr. TAVENNER. What occurred on the occasion of this visit to Cap-tain Tompkins?I don't remember anything in particular. Yes; onething. He said he wanted to write a book about me. He was a verygood writer. He had written for yachting magazines and had writtenseveral books with no political content whatever, and he thought it
Mr.HAYDEN.would be a good idea to write a biography of my life, and the slanthe wanted to give it was, "The development of a typical nonpoliticalAmerican youth into a militant participant in the class struggle,"something like that. I said O.K.; 0. K.So I went down to Hollywood and purchased a boat which I livedon, made my home on. Shortly thereafter, I would say in April, possibly the latter part of April or first of May, for 3 weeks he came onthe schooner with me and took notes copiously. He followed mewherever I went on the boat, and eventually he got 75,000 words written on the story before I "came to" sufficiently to call on him one dayand call the whole thing off.COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY
Mr. TAVENNER. When was it you called it off?139It was quite some-time later, I suppose?
Mr. HAYDEN. Yes; it was a long time later; a long time later.
Mr. TAVENNER. Before we go into that, I would like to know whatoccurred in the meantime. After your arrival in Hollywood, didyou become associated with any particular organizations there?
Mr. HAYDEN. I joined the Communist Party.
Mr. TAVENNER. You joined the Communist Party?
Mr. HAYDEN. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you tell the committee the circumstancesleading up to your actually becoming a card-carrying member, ordues-paying member, of the Communist Party ?
Mr. HAYDEN. Yes; I will. As I began to operate around and movearound Hollywood, I continued to talk, I would say almost incessantly, about this thing built up in me in Yugoslavia and the feelingI wanted to do something for a better world. That is a cliche expression, but I think it is accurate.Through Tompkins I was put in contact with a woman, Bea Winters. One day she said to me, "Why don't you stop talking and jointhe Communist Party?"I clearly remember my first reaction, which was, "This is ridiculous." However, I went ahead. She had a paper which I signed. Idon't know whether I signed Sterling Hayden or John Hamilton.John Hamilton was my legal name. I know I signed one of the twonames, and was almost immediately accepted into the party.
Mr. TAVENNER. How do you spell Bea ?
Mr. HAYDEN. B-e-a.
Mr. TAVENNER. How was she employed ?
Mr. HAYDEN. She was a secretary in the office of my agent.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was the name of your agent?
Mr. HAYDEN. Berg-Allen Berg, Inc.
Mr. TAVENNER. IS that agency in existence today ?
Mr. HAYDEN. It has since become amalgamated or merged with theWilliam Morris office.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you know whether Bea Winters' membershipin the Communist Party was known to the agency ?
Mr. HAYDEN. I think it is safe to say it was not, or she wouldn'thave been employed there.
Mr. TAVENNER. How is she employed now, do you Imow ?
Mr. HAYDEN. I have heard she was secretary to a producer. I can'tthink of his name.
Mr. MOULDER. Mr. Tavenner, will you fix the date when he joinedthe Communist Party ?
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes.Communist Party ?Can you fix the date when you joined the
Mr. HAYDEN. As nearly as I can remember-and I have no recordof it at all-it was approximately between the 5th and 15th of June1946, but that may not be accurate.
Mr. TAVENNER. Over how long a period of time were you acquaintedwith Bea Winters?
Mr. HAYDEN. Prior to this?
Mr. TAVENNER. Both prior and subsequently.
Mr. HAYDEN. I had known her before the war when she was withthe Berg-Allen Berg Agency.Nothing political was ever discussed.140COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRYI saw her again after the war, and I believe it was Tompkins who toldme she was very active politically. Then began the political phase ofthe association, you might say.
Mr. TAVENNER. How long were you acquainted with her after youbecame a member of the Communist Party ?
Mr.HAYDEN.She was a member of the cell or group that I wasassigned to up until the time that I broke with them, which was inDecember of that same year, 1946.
Mr. TAVE NNER. To what group of the Communist Party were youassigned upon your first joining the party?
Mr. HAYDEN. I was told that for security reasons I should not bewith any prominent people in any phase of endeavor at all in the motion-picture industry, but should be with people known as back-lotworkers, carpenters, electricians, and so forth, and so on.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you explain that a little further, about secur-ity ? Security for whom ?
Mr. HAYDEN. Security for me, I presume.It was never discussedvery much. I believe this cell was composed primarily of people fromUniversal, RKO, Columbia, and Paramount, but these people werenever known to me by their last names. It was only first names.Everybody called everybody else comrade.
Mr. TAVENNER. How many composed that cell?
Mr. HAYDEN. I don't know what the official membership was, butan average meeting would have from 10 to 22 or 23 people. I thinkthey were happy if they had more than 8.
Mr. TAVENNER. Who were the officers ?
Mr. HAYDEN. When I first joined there was a man who functioned assecretary, whose last name I do not know, whose first name wasHjalmar.
Mr. TAVENNER. How do you spell it?
Mr. HAYDEN. H-j-a-l-m-a-r.
Mr. TAVENNER. How was he employed ?
Mr. HAYDEN. I don't know. I don't know how he was employed.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you know by whom he was employed ?
Mr. HAYDEN. I couldn't say for sure, no. I was going to say Ithought he was at Paramount, but I am not sure.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you know where he lived ?
Mr. HAYDEN. I have no idea, although I may have gone to his house.I went to different houses by address. I don't know if I ever went tohis house, though it is likely I did. He functioned as secretary. Hekept records, collected dues, and so forth and so on.
Mr. TAVENNER. To whom did you pay your dues?
Mr. HAYDEN. TO him.
Mr. TAVENNER. What were your dues?
Mr. HAYDEN. The same as everybody else. They were computed ona percentage of salary, but I was not included in the percentage deal.I paid what everybody else paid. It seems to me it was $1.75, $2, or$2.50 a month.
Mr. TAVENNER. Can you recall the names of anybody else who weremembers of that group ?
Mr. HAYDEN. I remember the names Bernie and Frank.knew their last-names. I knew Bea Winters, of course.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was she a member of that same group ?
Mr. HAYDEN. She was.I neverCOMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY141
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you know how Bernie was employed?
Mr. HAYDEN. I do not.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you know where he lived
Mr. HAYDEN. I do not know that. I don't think I ever went to hishouse.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you say a person named Frank?
Mr. HAYDEN. Somebody named Frank.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you able to identify any of these people by anymanner to the committee, as to how they were employed and where,or where they lived, that might lead to a discovery of who they actuallyare?
Mr. HAYDEN. Only the man named Bernie, from the way he con-ducted himself; I would say he was employed in a white-collar capacity. He was more of an intellectual type than the others. Hefrequently would hold a discussion on the dialectical phases of communism, and so forth and so on.(Representatives Doyle, Velde, and Jackson left the hearing room.)
Mr. HAYDEN (continuing). All the rest. seemed to me to be employed as back-lot workers.
Mr. TAVENNER. Can you recall the names of any of the persons inwhose homes the meetings were held ?
Mr. HAYDEN. No, because when a meeting broke up somebody wouldsay, "We will meet next Friday night at such and such a time at suchan address." I would write down the address. I wasn't sure whosehouse it was.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you know an individual by the name of AbePolonsky ?
Mr. HAYDEN. Yes. The meetings were frequently held at Abe'shouse.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was he a member of this group ?
Mr. HAYDEN. He was later. About the time I terminated he beganto show up at meetings. In the early stages of the proceedings he didnot sit in on these meetings as I remember it.
Mr.TAVENNER. Washe known to you as a member of the Com-munist Party, from your.association with him?
Mr. HAYDEN. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. Is he currently a writer for Twentieth CenturyFox?
Mr. HAYDEN. I don't know who he is writing for. I don't knowanything about him.
Mr. WOOD. Mr. Counsel, will you suspend for a moment ?
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes. sir.
Mr. WOOD. Let the record disclose that the number of committee-men in attendance has been reduced, and that there are now presentmembers of the committee Walter, Moulder, Potter, and Wood, beingless than a quorum. By virtue of authority vested in me under theresolution creating this committee, I hereby establish a subcommitteeto proceed with the hearing until a quorum returns.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you give any further information you haveas regards Abe Polonsky and his activities in the Communist Party ?
Mr. HAYDEN. Yes.In all honesty, I know little on that score.Initially, I had the feeling he was involved elsewhere. While themeetings were held at his house, he was seldom present until 2 or 3months had elapsed, after which he began to appear fairly regularly,142COMMUNISMIN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRYand after that functioned as sort of head of the group. Outside ofthat, I know nothing of his activities.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you acquainted with Robert Lees?
Mr. HAYDEN. Robert Lees was a member of this group.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did he meet on more than one occasion with thissame group?
Mr. HAYDEN. Yes; he did.
Mr. TAVENNER. How often do you think he was there while you werethere ?
Mr. HAYDEN. I could only guess, and I don't like to guess on thingslike this. I would say 10 or 12 times.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you recall whether you met at his home on anyoccasion ?
Mr. HAYDEN. I think we did on one occasion.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was the purpose of the holding of these meetings for this particular group that you were assigned to?
Mr. HAYDEN. The over-all purpose was simply that these peoplewere Communists and they met to discuss what was going on. In ameeting the discussion would usually be split up into what was goingon in the industry that concerned them, and then part of the meetingwould be devoted to the world situation, theoretical diagnoses, and soforth.
Mr. TAVENNER. In other words, part of the time was devoted to thestudy of the principles of the Communist Party?
Mr. HAYDEN. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. How long did you continue in that cell?
Mr. HAYDEN. That was the only cell I ever belonged to.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you have any particular assignment while youwere a member of that cell?
Mr. HAYDEN. After about-and here, again, I do not remember thedate. It wouldn't be hard to fix it, because sometime the latter partof that summer or early in the fall the Conference of Studio Unions,which is a sort of amalgamation of locals in the industry, went out onstrike. At that time the focal point of interest became the prosecution of this stand that these people had taken.I was told that it would be very helpful and important if the ScreenActors' Guild could be swung into line in support of this strike.
Mr. TAVENNER. You were told that by whom?
Mr. HAYDEN. I don't know; somebody in this group.
Mr. TAVENNER. It was a Communist order or suggestion?
Mr. HAYDEN. That is the way it came to me.
Mr. TAVENNER. It came to you in a Communist meeting by membersof the Communist Party?
Mr. HAYDEN. Yes. So I went first-and I don't remember who toldme to go to it-to a large cocktail party where 60 or 70 people interested in this phase of endeavor, you might say,. were present, andthrough this initial meeting I began to meet a group of actors andactresses who all felt the same way. This was a very loose category ofpeople. however.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was that the group with whom you were directedto work?
Mr. HAYDEN. NO. I still attended meetings with this same group,but they told me I should be concerned primarily with actors, and theythought I should contact the Screen Actors' Guild for support of theCOMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY143position of the Conference of Studio Unions, and I was told to associate with these people.
Mr. TAVENNER. Who were working for the same purpose ?
Mr. HAYDEN. It coincided. I would like to say at this point, therewere a great, great many people involved here. I don't know whatpercentage of the actors and actresses involved were a long, long,long way from being Communists in any sense of the word, so far asI know.
Mr. TAVENNER. You have given a list of the persons connected withthat movement to the investigators of this committee, have you not ?
Mr. HAYDEN. Yes, I have; to the best of my recollection.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are there any of that group whom you can identifyas members of the Communist Party, to your knowledge? I am notasking you for names of people generally who were with you in thisproject, unless they were known to you to be members of the Communist Party.
Mr. HAYDEN. I understand. I wouldn't hesitate to say Karen Mor-ley, inasmuch as in 1947, a long time after I had completely severedany and all connections with any form of Communist activities orendeavor, she came to me and asked me to come back, so I certainlythink it is safe to assume that she was a member. Over and abovethat, it would have to get into the realm of conjecture, which, frankly,I am somewhat doubtful of.
Mr. TAVENNER. I don't want you to go into the field of conjecture.
Mr. HAYDEN. NO.(Representative Doyle returns to hearing room.)
Mr. TAVENNER. NOW I want to ask you a few more questions aboutthis meeting which you were directed to attend in carrying out yourCommunist Party obligations. You said there were 50 or more people present, as I understood you ?
Mr. HAYDEN. There were 60 or 70 people there.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did that group narrow down to a comparativelyfew who actually functioned ?
Mr. HAYDEN. I would say there was a nucleus that would attendmeetings more regularly. When there were gatherings to see whatcould be done, there were certain people who would appear more regularly. There were people on the periphery, on the edge, who wouldbe there sometimes; and other people were there more regularly.
Mr. TAVENNER. How frequently did you meet to work on thatenterprise ?
Mr. HAYDEN. I would say once or twice a week.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did Karen Morley meet with you?
Mr. HAYDEN. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. Where were these meetings held?
Mr. HAYDEN. Some were held at Karen Morley's house.Somewere held at a house owned by a man named Morris Carnovsky, who,I might say, was never present. And others were held at homes whichI only knew at that time by address.(Representative Jackson returns to hearing room.)
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you acquainted with a person by the name ofLloyd Gough?
Mr. HAYDEN. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. G-o-u-g-h, is that the correct spelling of thename?
Mr. HAYDEN. I think it is.144COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY
Mr. TAVENNER. Did he attend those meetings?
Mr. HAYDEN. Yes; he did.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you have any knowledge on your own part asto whether or not he was a member of the Communist Party?
Mr. HAYDEN. Well, I would say it would probably be safe to assumethat he was.
Mr. TAVENNER. I don't want you to assume it.
Mr. HAYDEN. I have absolutely, categorically, no knowledge thathe was.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you acquainted with Howard da Silva?
Mr. HAYDEN. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did he attend those meetings?
Mr. HAYDEN. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. Have you any personal knowledge as to whether ornot he was a member of the Communist Party ?
Mr. HAYDEN. Only in his behavior before this committee.
Mr. TAVENNER. I understand that you withdrew or terminated yourconnection with the Communist Party the same year in which youjoined it?
Mr. HAYDEN. That is right.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you tell the committee what led up to the termination of your relationship with the Communist Party, and whetheryour break was an actual break and a final break with the CommunistParty?
Mr. HAYDEN. Thank you very much.That I would like to do.As I think is abundantly clear-and I don't make any apologyI do not mean to imply that I was dragged into the thing in any way,shape, or manner. I went into the thing voluntarily. Certainly Ithink it was the stupidest, most ignorant thing I have ever done, andI have done a good many such things, but I did go into it with a veryemotional and very unsound approach.' I hadn't been in very longI would say it took me 3 or 4 months to realize the true nature of whatI had done.I would like to say at this time, without launching into a long dissertation on this thing, that one thing that decided me once and forall against the whole business was the manner in which everything ispredetermined. I think I had become susceptible to and, in a sense,perhaps, a victim of the idea that they had a form of democracy inmind. That was in my mind during the Yugoslav days and the timeI joined. I found the belief is that they have the key, by some occultpower, to know what is best for people, and that is the way it is goingto be. I think any 'Communist or pseudo-Communist who pretends itis other than this is falsifying the fact.When I learned about this and began to think about it and digest ita bit, I decided to get out, and I got out.I would like to take this opportunity, if I may, to briefly state for therecord a sort of synopsis of my complete association with anythingthat was Communist or might be construed as Communist front. Iwould like to lump it and say categorically that is all there is to it,and anybody who insinuates it is not, is mistaken.I belonged to this cell that I mentioned.
Mr. TAVENNER. First let me ask: Have you become a member ofany other organizations since you terminated your relationship withCOMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY145the Communist Party which has been cited as a Communist front, orhas had Communist Party leanings, so far as you know
Mr. HAYDEN. I know of one instance, and I would like to set thatstraight. There was an outfit in Hollywood, the Committee for theFirst Amendment, formed in October 1947. I broke once and forall with the Communist thing in December 1946. Actually, the breakcoincided with the fact I was living on my boat in Santa Barbara.That summer my wife and I went East, on the coast of Maine, andwhen we came back I had a call from Alexander Knox saying thisCommittee for the First Amendment was being formed, and wouldI join. I said I would think it over.I was told who was sponsoring it, spearheading it. I thoughtit over very carefully, and I assured myself-I may be wrong, butmy conclusion was that this was in no way a Communist front atthat time.So I joined, and I came to Washington in the fall, I think, Octoberof that year, 1947.I would like to go on with the people who did join. I think youare probably familiar with the membership list of that organization,and if it has since been determined that this thing was spearheadedby Communists, believe me these people didn't know it. The peoplewho lent their names and gave money to this Committee for the FirstAmendment, to the best of my knowledge certainly had no ideathat it was a Communist front, any more than I had.That is the one thing which, as you said, has been cited.
Mr. TAVENNER. Who were those who spearheaded the Committeefor the First Amendment, to your knowledge ?
Mr. HAYDEN. The first name that comes to mind is HumphreyBogart, and his wife. It would be hard for me to remember. Iwish I had a list. I know it runs into hundreds of so-called Hollywood names. I know there was a tremendous gathering at IraGershwin's house at which a couple of hundred people were present.The spokesmen were John Huston and Phil Dunne. It is commonknowledge all the people who flew East at that time.
Mr. TAYENNER. I interrupted you in the course of your statement.
Mr. HAYDEN. I would like to go on and sum this thing up once andfor all, if I may.I did belong to the Communist Party from June until the middleof December 1946.
Mr. TAVENNER. When you joined the Communist Party, were youadvised by anyone that to do so would improve your chance of promotion in Hollywood ?
Mr. HAYDEN. No; I was not. On the contrary, I had certain reser-vations in my mind and I kept pretty quiet, I kept completely quiet,about my association with the Communist Party. I didn't think itwould help me in any way, shape, or manner; on the contrary.
Mr. TAVENNER. In the course of your experience in Hollywood, didyou at any time become acquainted with any Communist activity onthe part of any high official of the motion picture industry ?
Mr. HAYDEN. Yes, there was one instance.Shortly after I joined,I would say in July, Bea Winters said there was an important manwho would like to come and talk with me. We met at the restaurantVictor's on Sunset Boulevard. He came in. I don't know the name146COMMUNISM INMOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRYby which he was introduced to me. After reading certain newspaperstories subsequent to this event I figured his name was John Stapp. Iknow he was introduced as John.
Mr. TAVENNER. S-t-a-p-p?
Mr. HAYDEN. Yes.I think he has other names. He asked whatmade me think I wanted to be a Communist.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was he a member of the Hollywood motion pic-ture industry?
Mr. HAYDEX. I have no idea.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, possibly from my question it might havebeen misinterpreted. He was a high functionary in the CommunistParty .
Mr. HAYDEN. I was told he was an important man.
Mr. TVE-NNER. But not in the Hollywood motion picture industry?
Mr. HAYDEN. I don't think he was in any way employed in theindustry; not in any way.
Mr.
Mr.
Mr.
Mr.TAVENNER. Go aheadHAYDEN. With Johnwith your experience.Stapp?TA\VENNER. Yes.HAYDEN. He asked why I had joined, and I went into theYugoslavia thing. He asked if I had any militant trade-union background. and I said I did not. The conversation was more or less parallel with the conversation I had with Jerome, where I figured he wasdoing some calculating. He didn't say anything to me at all. Ithink he said he doubted that I would make a good Communist, but Iam not sure.
Mr. TAVEXER. Going back to my original question, did any knowledge come to you at any time of activities on the part of any highranking official in the Hollywood motion picture industry that wouldindicate Communist Party membership on the part of any suchindividual ?
Mr. HAYDEN. No.with that.I think of nothing whatsoever in connection
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you acquainted with Edward G. Robinson?
Mr. HAYDEN. I met Mr. Robinson backstage at a rally for Israelone evening, and chatted with him a couple of minutes before he madea speech.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did he attend any Communist Party meetingswhich you attended ?
Mr. HAYDEN. NO.
Mr. TAVENNER. Please proceed to sum up what you had in mindsaying.
Mr. HAYDEN. I mentioned the cell, which lasted for 5 or 6 months.There was the activity in this minority group within the ScreenActors' Guild.As soon as I got back in Hollywood I joined the Hollywood Independent Citizens' Committee of the Arts, Sciences and Professions,HICCASP. I paid dues through December. I never participated ina single thing in their behalf.I joined the American Veterans' Committee at the same time. Imade two speeches for them on Yugoslavia, one in Pomona and one inSanta Barbara. I spoke on the fighting in Yugoslavia.'COMMUNISMIN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY147Then there is the Committee for the First Amendment, which I suppose could be construed as such since it has since been cited as a frontorganization.And as I indicated earlier, this is the total, without reservation orlimitation.I have a brief list of contributions which I wanted to put in.
Mr. TAVENNER. What were the organizations to which you con-tributed ?
Mr. HAYDEN. I contributed $100 to HICCASP.Three hundred dollars, one check, to Abe Polonsky. As I remember,this was for the families of the strikers in the CSU. That may bewrong. It may have been for the Communist Party.I paid my Communist Party dues.I paid my AVC dues, $2.75 per month.I paid my HICCASP dues.I once gave Tompkins $75 for the People's World when they weretrying to keep on printing.That was the total.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were all these contributions made prior to yourleaving the party?
Mr. HAYDEN. Except for $100 to the Committee for the FirstAmendment.
Mr. TAVENNER. You have indicated that after your relationshipwith the Communist Party was severed, that Karen Morley came toyou and asked you to come back into the party.
Mr. HAYDEN. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you give the committee the entire transactionas it occurred ?
Mr. HAYDEN. She came to our house. I had remarried in June ofthat year. She came to our house, I believe, right after or before theCommittee for the First Amendment was formed. She came and saidshe wanted me to consider coming back in, and I said, "There is nothingto be considered. This is it. There is nothing to discuss" and so forthand so on.As she left the house I took her out to the front hall, and she said,"I hope you realize that having made that decision, it will be ex-tremely hard for you to ever get back in." And I said, "Nothing willplease me more." That ended it.
Mr. TAVENNER. During the course of the conversation, was any-thing said about your becoming a passive member?
Mr. HAYDEN. Yes. I forgot that. She said, "Since you don't wantto be an active member, will you contribute money?"I said, "No."(Representative Velde returns to the hearing room.)
Mr. TAVENNER. In other words, in Hollywood there is such a thingas a passive membership, or a contributing membership, without attending meetings and so forth?
Mr. HAYDEN. That is the way I understood it.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you know of any instance in which that type ofmembership is being maintained ?
Mr. HAYDEN. I do not.
Mr. TAVENNER. You have cooperated with the committee by tellingthe investigators, in advance of this hearing today, what you haveknown of communism in your own life and in Hollywood. Have you81595-51-pt. 1--7148COMMUNISMIN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRYtaken any other action besides that which would indicate good faithon your part in the break which you claim you have made with theCommunist Party?
Mr. HAYDEN. I believe I have. One month after South Korea wasinvaded, through my attorney, a letter was sent to Mr. J. EdgarHoover, Federal Bureau of Investigation, in which was set forth thefact that for a period of 5 to 6 months I had been a member of theCommunist Party, and with the world going the way it was, it seemedentirely probably that a conflagration would develop, and I hope,if that was the case, my services would not be denied, if the MarineCorps could use me, on the basis of this mistake I had made.I have a photostatic copy of that letter I would like to produce orread for the record.
Mr. TAVENNER. Suppose you produce it and read it into the record.
Mr. HAYDEN. (Reading:)JULY 31, 1950.FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION,Washington., D. C.(Attention Mr. J. Edgar Hoover)DEAR SIa: This office has a client who has discussed with us a problem whichI believe can only be answered through your organization.In June of 1946 this young man, in a moment of emotional disturbance, became a bona fide member of the Communist Party in the State of California.In November of 1946 he decided that he had made a mistake and terminated hismembership and his association with the. Communist Party. Ever since November of 1946 this client has had no connection whatsoever with the Communist Party or with an organization affiliated with it.The gentleman in question is an American-born citizen with a distinguishedwar record. He enlisted in the Marine Corps as a private and received histermination as a captain. Because of his distinguished services he received theSilver Star medal with citation from the commanding general, MediterraneanTheater of Operations, United States Army. The citation recognized his gallantry in action in the Mediterranean Theater of Operations with the UnitedStates Marine Corps Reserve.Our client is not engaged in any activity where security is involved. However,since the commencement of the operation in Korea, he has felt that the timemay come, in the near future, when his services might be of aid to the UnitedStates. He is concerned with the fact that his brief membership in the Communist Party, as aforesaid, may operate to prevent the use of his services.In addition to the foregoing, he is married and has young children. If hisservices are not needed by the United States, conditions may develop so as torequire an answer in connection with ordinary employment to the query:"Are you now or have you ever been a Communist?"Our client can, of course, answer honestly and frankly that he is not now amember of the Communist Party. He could not answer the rest of the compound question without (a) either lying, or (b) if he told the truth he wouldprobably find himself unable to earn a living.While it must be admitted that a mistake was made in 1946, it does appearthat justice requires some method by which one mistake does not operate (a)to prevent the United States from making use of the services of our client, (b)to prevent our client from earning a living.He is perfectly willing to submit to any interrogation or examination by theFederal Bureau of Investigation so that that organization may be convincedof his sincerity and of the truth of all the statements related herein.The purpose of this, of course, is to permit our client, if the compound question is asked him, to say in answer to the question, "Please inquire of the Federal Bureau of Investigation." The Federal Bureau of Investigation couldthen notify the prospective employer that there was no reason for not employingour client.We would appreciate hearing from you at your earliest convenience.Sincerely yours,GANG, KoPP & TYBE,By MARTIN GANG.COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY149
Mr. TAVENNER. Was a reply received from the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation ?
Mr. HAYDEN. Yes. I have that here.
Mr.. TAVENNER. Will you read it into the record ?
Mr. HAYDEN (reading):AUGUST 15, 1950.
Mr. MARTIN GANG:401 Taft Building, Los Angeles 28, Calif.DEAR SIR : Your letter of July 31, 1950, has been received and I want to thankyou for making these facts available to me. I have given your letter carefulconsideration and I am fully cognizant of the problem which confronts you andyour client.I regret to inform you, however, that it has been a long-standing policy of thisBureau not to grant a clearance to any person and I am, therefore, unable toassist you in the manner which you suggest.May I suggest, however, that inasmuch as this Bureau has primary investigative jurisdiction of matters concerning the internal security of our country,it is considered advisable that your client furnish our Los Angeles office withdetails concerning his membership in the Communist Party together with thenature of the party activities during that period.In order to comply with this request may I suggest that you contact Mr. R. B.Hood, special agent in charge of our Los Angeles office, 900 Security Building,Los Angeles 13, Calif., in order to arrange for an interview of your client.Very truly yours,(S) J. E. HOOVER,JOHN EDGAR HOOVER, Director.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you report as requested in that letter ?
Mr. HAYDEN. Yes, I did. I don't remember just how soon after wereceived this letter from Mr. Hoover. I believe it was early in Au-gust. And subsequently I met with them on two other occasions anddiscussed the thing in complete detail as I have today.
Mr. TAVENNER. Have you anything further you desire to add ?
Mr. HAYDEN. I think we have covered the ground pretty well.Iwould like to say that I appreciate very much, very, very much, theopportunity to appear here today. I think that there is a tremendousservice to be rendered, not only to the country at large but to the motion-picture industry and also to those individuals who find themselves in a similar position to mine.I have heard that there are many, many thousands-I have heardthere are hundreds of thousands-of ex-Communists who don't knowwhat to do about it. I would like, if it is not presumptuous, to suggest in all humility that perhaps some provision could be made bylaw to permit people who had had a similar experience to make theirposition known and clear, so that they could get this thing off theirchest, because, believe me, it is a load to carry around with you.
Mr. TAVENNER. I might say, in that connection, that the chairmanof this committee, in a broadcast not along ago, invited those who werein this category to make that fact known to this committee, and theywould keep it in confidence if that was desired, but to make knowntheir participation so that it would be a matter of record now as to justwhat their participation had been, and there has been a very fine response to that.
Mr. HAYDEN. I didn't realize that.
Mr. TAVENNER. I have no further questions, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. WOOD. Mr. Walter.
Mr. WALTER. I would like to ask a question about this Committeefor the First Amendment. What representations were made to you150COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRYconcerning the need for an organization to protect the first amendment to the Constitution?
Mr. HAYDEN. As I recall it, the basic premise of the organizationwas that a man was entitled to whatever political beliefs he.mighthave, and that nobody could inquire into them. I think that this wasthe idea they had in mind at the time.
Mr. WALTER. That is all.
Mr. WooD. Mr. Doyle.
Mr. DOYLE. Mr. Hayden, in reference to your last statement, I believe you said you are very, very grateful to the committee for theopportunity to get this thing off your chest. Then you added, "Be-lieve me, it is a load." What did you mean by that ?
Mr. HAYDEN. Well, conditions, of course, it seems to me, from mypersonal experience, were a great deal different in 1946 than today.As I have indicated, I went into the thing of my own free will, impulsively, stupidly, but I did get into it. When I realized I was wrong,I got out.
Mr. DOYLE. What happened to cause you to come to the conclusionyou had committed error ?
Mr. HAYDEN. One of the prime things was taking refuge in certainamendments to the Constitution.At that time I was pretty muchof a greenhorn, but as soon as I realized the Communists were takingrefuge under the amendments to our Constitution that they underno circumstances would permit others to takeMr. DOYLE. Taking refuge from what?
Mr. HAYDEN. Taking refuge in the fifth amendment or the firstamendment and considering that their political connections could notbe questioned.
Mr. DOYLE. What led you to believe they were taking refuge in thefirst and fifth amendments?
Mr. HAYDEN. I believe in this investigation certain people havestood on the fifth amendment.
Mr. DOYLE. That is only in the last year or so.
Mr. HAYDEN. That is right.
Mr. DOYLE. And you resigned from the Communist Party in 1946.
Mr. HAYDEN. Yes.
Mr. DOYLE. That is 4 years ago.What did you discover prior tothe time you resigned which caused you, if anything did cause you,to come to the conclusion that you could not consistently continuelonger as a member of the Communist Party ?
Mr. HAYDEN. One thing was when I became aware of the totali-tarian idea of communism, which had been obscured by the fog inthe war years.
Mr. DOYLE. I believe you testified when you accepted Bea Winters'invitation to join the Communist Party, the meetings of the cellindicated, did they not, the totalitarian nature of the CommunistParty?
Mr. HAYDEN. Yes; they did; but, unfortunately, it took some timefor my awareness of this to overcome the initial headway I hadbuilt up.
Mr. DOYLE. When you say you discovered the totalitarian natureof the Communist Party, what do you mean by that? What does"totalitarian nature of the Communist Party" mean to you that causedyou to resignCOMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY151
Mr. HAYDEN. That a very few people, or a certain group of people,know what is best for the majority, and the will of the majority hasno bearing on what is done for the majority. That, I believe, iswrong.
Mr. DOYLE. Did you discover at any time that the Communist Partywas encouraging devious ways to upset or overthrow or overcome,by force if necessary, the republican form of government that we haveunder our Constitution in the United States ?
Mr. HAYDEN. I certainly believe that to be the case.
Mr. DOYLE. When did you come to that conclusion ?
Mr. HAYDEN. I don't remember the exact time.
Mr. DOYLE. Approximately?
Mr. HAYDEN. Approximately at the time I severed my connection.
Mr. DOYLE. That was when? You might have testified to thatwhen I was out of the room voting.
Mr. HAYDEN. December 1946.
Mr. DOYLE. As I say, I had to go out of the room to vote, so I didn'thave the benefit of hearing your full testimony. I left the room justat the time you were testifying that Bea Winters was a member of acell with you. So I don't know if you told the names of other members of that cell, or those whom you know as Communists.
Mr. HAYDEN. To the best of my knowledge I did.
Mr. DOYLE. Was that question asked, Mr. Counsel?
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes, and his answer was he knew them only bytheir first names with the exception of two, Abe Polonsky and RobertLees, whom he identified.
Mr. DOYLE. Were the members of this cell all men?
Mr. HAYDEN. No; men and women.
Mr. DOYLE. About what proportion?
Mr. HAYDEN. Two-thirds men and one-third women.
Mr. DOYLE. How many members in the cell?
Mr. HAYDEN. There were from 10 to 23 or 25.
Mr. DOYLE. How often did they meet?
Mr. HAYDEN. Weekly.
Mr. DOYLE. Did they have a regular meeting place ?
Mr. HAYDEN. It was at a different house almost every week. Several meetings were held at the house of a man named Abe Polonsky.
Mr. DOYLE. Were members of the cell all actors or actresses?
Mr. HAYDEN. None of them were actors or actresses.
Mr. DOYLE. You were an actor?
Mr. HAYDEN. Yes, I was. As I said, I was told when my application was accepted that I would be put in a cell of back-lot people.
Mr. DonY.I believe you said they were carpenters, electricians,and so on?
Mr. HAYDEN. Yes.
Mr. DoYLE. Didn't you recognize some of them by name? Theywere all in the industry, weren't they ?
Mr. HAYDEN. Yes, they were all in the industry, but it is a largeindustry. There are 20,000 to 30,000 people in the industry, I believe.
Mr. DoYLE. And you associated with those people in that cell fromwhat date?
Mr. HAYDEN. About the first week of June.
Mr. DOYi. Until December 1946?
Mr. HAYDEN. Yes, sir.152COMMUNISM INMOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY
Mr. DOYLE. Then it is your testimony that from June 1946 to December 1946 you associated weekly with members of the cell at meetings, and you only know the names of two members of the cell?
Mr. HAYDEN. We met 2 to 3 months on this basis, at which time Iwas put in touch with a group of actors and actresses trying to swingthe Screen Actors' Guild in line with a strike then in progress. Ithen met very infrequently with this initial cell.
Mr. DOYLE. Did you ever receive any literature from Tompkins oranyone else which, in printed form, made any declaration or statedany policy or objective that caused you to conclude that the Communist Party, of which you later became a member, was interested inrevolution against the American form of government ?
Mr. HAYDEN. As I recall, it was always couched in other terms. Ithink a more perceptive person would have seen it. I did not at thetime.
Mr. DOYLE. You believe the literature you received from Tompkinsdid advocate the overthrow of the American form of government?
Mr. HAYDEN. I think that was the ultimate objective; yes.
Mr. DoYLE. Do ou have any of that literature now?
Mr. HAYDEN. NO.
Mr. DOYLE. Do you know where any of it could be had?
Mr. HAYDEN. No. I know it used to be out in plain sight in some ofthe book stores.
Mr. DOYLE. Can you identify any of those book stores by name orlocation ?
Mr. HAYDEN. I cannot offhand.
Mr. DOYLE. Do you think your memory could be refreshed?
Mr. TAVENNER. What was your question?
Mr. DOYLE. My question was whether or not the witness now recalled the name or location of any book stores which carried Communist literature which the witness states he now realizes advocated theoverthrow of our American form of government.Were any of them in Hollywood ?
Mr. HAYDEN. I remember a book store, I don't know if it is in existence any more; the Lincoln Book Store, I think it was. I don't knowwhere it was.
Mr. DOYLE. When was that?
Mr. HAYDEN. 1946.
Mr. DOYLE. Did you ever receive literature from that book store ?
Mr. HAYDEN. I went in there once or twice,
Mr. DOYLE. Did they ever hand you some literature for free distribution?
Mr. HAYDEN. There was a lot of throw-away stuff on the table, as Iremember it.
Mr. DOYLE. You stated you came to think there was a great serviceto do the country and the industry. I suppose you were referring tothe moving-picture industry. Does the moving-picture industry, inyour judgment, need any service in connection with who are and whoare not Communists and who were Communists previously, and if so,what service?
Mr. HAYDEN. My thought on that was simply, as I guess is common knowledge now, there is a great furor in Hollywood about thewhole situation. My idea was that if ex-Communists, or people whohad been affiliated with Communist fronts, felt they could stand upCOMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY153and be counted and be judged on the facts, it would clarify the situa-tion.
Mr. DOYLE. Is it or not a fact that the moving-picture industry orcolony has been pretty actively endeavoring to clean up the situation?
Mr. HAYDEN. I think that would expedite it.
Mr. DOYLE. You haven't answered my question.
Mr. HAYDEN. I am sorry.
Mr. DOYLE. I will ask it this way: To your knowledge has themoving-picture industry been endeavoring to clean up its ownhouse.
Mr. HAYDEN. I certainly think it has.
Mr. DOYLE. Do you think it is doing a pretty good job of it?
Mr. HAYDEN. I think it is; so far as I know.
Mr. DOYLE. I take it your voluntary testimony this morning iswhat you feel should be done by other former Communists who happened to be engaged in the art of acting?
Mr. HAYDEN. That it is. That is up to them, but that is my re-action.
Mr. DOYLE. As you testified, I quickly made notes of this part ofyour testimony:I was boiling inside. If I could do something about conditions, it mightjustify my being an actor with high income and pleasant working conditions.Do you recall stating substantially that?
Mr. HAYDEN. Yes, sir.
Mr. DoYLE. What were the conditions that you were boiling up in-side about, that you wanted to help correct?
Mr. HAYDEN. I think it was a peculiarly personal thing with me.I came into the industry with an irregular background, with no back-ground in the conventional way of earning a living, having alwaysbeen at sea. I suddenly found myself making a lot of money and notdoing a great deal of work for it, and I felt a responsibility I shouldhave had earlier as an American citizen. I had never thoughtpolitically before. All of this came to focus at one time, and, un-fortunately perhaps, the increment that set it off was my experiencein Yugoslavia.(Representative Kearney enters hearing room.)
Mr. DOYLE. At that time you were not interested in any economicconditions facing our country; it only involved your personal boilingup inside ?
Mr. HAYDEN. That is very close to being correct.
Mr. DOYE. Am I correct?
Mr. HAYDEN. You are very nearly correct.
Mr. DOYLE. It was a personal matter'?
Mr. HAYDEN. Yes.
Mr. DOYLE. When Bea Winters in June 1946 handed you an appli-cation and asked why you didn't jbin the party-I believe that wasyour testimony?
Mr. HAYDEN. Yes.
Mr. DOYLE. And then told you you could not be a member of acell where all members were actors, for security reasons, didn't it thenoccur to you there was something phony or dangerous about the154COMMUNISM INMOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRYCommunist Party, when, for security reasons, you could not belongto a cell where actors belonged?
Mr. HAYDEN. Yes; it did.
Mr. DOYLE. What occurred to you?
Mr. HAYDEN. As I said before, it was a rash move, an impulsivemove, but I was under such a head of steam at the time I simply didnot think the thing out very carefully. I went ahead anyway.
Mr. DOYLE. In other words, you were so enraptured with the Par-tisans of Yugoslavia, their bravery and heroism, and you had so tiedyourself up with Tompkins and others, that you could not immediately withdraw from the Communist Party ?
Mr. HAYDEN. I could have withdrawn, but I couldn't see clearlyat that time. I think that is accurate.
Mr. DOYLE. Did it ever occur to you, between June and December1946, what the security reasons were? What security reasons didyou discover, if any ?
Mr. HAYDEN. My feeling on that was simply that at that time I wasemployed by Paramount, and I felt that had it been known to Paramount that I was a member of the Communist Party, that I wouldno longer be employed by Paramount.
Mr. DOYLE. YOU stated Captain Tompkins got some 75,000 wordswritten on your biography before you "came to" sufficiently to go tohim and call the whole thing pff.
Mr. HAYDEN. That is right.
Mr. DOYLE. I think that is the substance of your testimony ?
Mr. HAYDEN. Yes.
Mr. DOYLE. What was it that caused you to "come to" sufficientlyto go to this long-time friend of yours, adviser. He had been anadviser, I take it ?
Mr. HAYDEN. Yes.
Mr. DOYLE. What gave you the backbone to go to him?you discover about the 75,000 words?What did
Mr. HAYDEN. The first draft he had knocked out actually fell bythe wayside when I realized what I had done. It was not the book.I never read the book.
Mr. DOYLE. Was the book published ?
Mr. HAYDEN. Heaven forbid. No.
Mr. DOYLE. Was it ever reduced to typewritten form ?
Mr. HAYDEN. Only the first draft.My wife has frequently sug-gested I get it back. I don't know what happened to it.
Mr. DOYLE. Do you feel if you made a demand on Tompkins for ityou would get it back?
Mr. HAYDEN. I have no idea.
Mr. DOYLE. Did you accept money or anything of value for thescript ?
Mr. HAYDEN. Nothing whatever.expelled from the party.I have heard since he has beenI don't know anything about that.
Mr. DoYLE. That is all, Mr. Chairman. Thank you very much.
Mr. WOOD. Mr. Moulder, do you have any questions ?
Mr. MOULDER. Not at this time.
Mr. WOOD. Mr. Velde.
Mr. VELDE. I want to preface my questions by stating that, speak-ing for myself only as a member of the committee, I certainly appreciate your cooperation with the committee in giving us so many de-COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY155tails as you have concerning your affiliation with the Communist Party.However, it occurs to me that the names of your associates in the Communist Party are, for some reason, a little bit obscure, and I can understand why that is so. I know you have been through a lot of questioning, both by our very able investigators and by FBI agents, and thequestions I ask you are for the purpose of prodding your memory andnot for doubting your testimony.I wish you would go back and review your associations in Yugoslavia, and name the persons you were associated with there who werein the Partisan movement at that time.
Mr. HAYDEN. The first names that come to my mind are ColonelManola, who at one time functioned in some executive capacity in Bariheadquarters in Bari, Italy; and Col. Sergei Mackiedo, who was theman who notified me I had received this decoration from the YugoslavGovernment.
Mr. VELDE. Were they American citizens ?
Mr. HAYDEN. No. These are Partisans. Do you want Americancitizens ?
Mr. VELDE. I want both.
Mr. HAYDEN. Thes two are Partisans. I can remember a mannamed Ivosevich, who was first mate.
Mr. VELDE. I wonder if you would spell that ?
Mr. HAYDEN. I-v-o-s-e-v-i-c-h, I think. There may be a "t" in it.And Nikolich, N-i-k-o-l-i-c-h.
Mr. VELDE. Did you meet Tito?
Mr. HAYDEN. I never met Tito.
Mr. VELDE. Proceed.
Mr. HAYDEN. I don't think of any other names.
Mr. VELDE. What about Americans?
Mr. HAYDEN. American OSS officers in Bari, Capt. Haus Tofte; Lt.Bob Thompson; Lt. Ward Ellen; Lieutenant Benson; Sgt. JohnHarnicker, Marine Corps; Major Koch; Maj. Linn Farish, who waskilled in Greece. I guess there are a lot of others. Their names don'tcome to my mind.
Mr. VELDE. For the purpose of clarifying the record for people whomay believe you are listing members of the Communist Party, if anyof those you have listed are known to you to be or to have been members of the Communist Party, so state.
Mr. HAYDEN. TO my knowledge, none of them had any connectionwhatever. These were simply fellow officers or enlisted men withwhom I worked.
Mr. VELDE. Was there an OSS officer from Pittsburgh ?
Mr. HAYDEN. There were a number from around the Pittsburghdistrict. There are only three I recall, though there are lots of others.
Mr. VELDE. Were they members of the Communist Party ? Can youidentify any of them as members of the Communist Party ?
Mr. HAYDEN. No. I have heard subsequently that one of them,George Wuchinich, was in some way connected with the CommunistParty. The others were strictly anti-Communist.
Mr. VELDE. Will you tell the committee how you felt, or know,that George Wuchinich was associated with the Communist Party ?
Mr. HAYDEN. I don't know when or how I heard it, but at sometime since the war I have heard that mentioned.
Mr. VELDE. Scuttle butt?156COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY
Mr. HAYDEN. Let's say scuttle butt.
Mr. VELDE. When was it you made your first trip back to the Statesafter being in Yugoslavia?
Mr. HAYDEN. I think late November or early December 1944.
Mr. VELDE. Will you again review-I was gone part of the time youtestified, for a vote-will you again review in more or less detail whowere on the boat you came on, where you went, and what happenedduring the time you were back in the States in 1944.
Mr. HAYDEN. The boat I came on was a transport. Ninety-ninepercent of the people on it were Regular Army and Air Force personnel coming on some rotation, I imagine. A few from OSS werecoming home.At the time I came here, or shortly afterward, I flew to the westcoast to visit Tompkins.
Mr. VELDE. What port did you enter?
Mr. HAYDEN. Staten Island. I reported in, came to Washington,got my leave papers, flew to San Francisco, and spent 5 or 6 dayswith Tompkins.
Mr. VELDE. Have you seen Mr. Tompkins recently?
Mr. HAYDEN. The last time I saw him was 2 years ago when mywife and I were living on a boat at San Pedro and he and his wife andson, who had worked for me once, strolled by. We discussed nothing.
Mr. VELDE. You had no conversation with him?
Mr. HAYDEN. No conversation except about boats.
Mr. VELDE. Will you proceed.
Mr. HAYDEN. After that 5 or 6 days I flew back to Washington,contacted Tompkins about who I could contact in New York, whowould know about guerrila movements in the world.
Mr. VELDE. Will you go back to the 5 or 6 days you spent withTompkins.
Mr. HAYDEN. It was just meeting people all the time, people coming.to the boat, and we got in the car and visited people's homes. Differentevenings we woul dgo to people's homes, sit around, and talk to them.The only name brought out in the testimony was Dr. Ellwood Lyman,who to the best of my knowledge was not a Communist.
Mr. VELDE. I believe you mentioned it was during this time youmet Steve Nelson?
Mr. HAYDEN. Yes.
Mr. VELDE. Where was this meeting?
Mr. HAYDEN. It may have been at the home of Dr. Lyman. It mayhave been at some other person's home.
Mr. VELDE. How many people were present?
Mr. HAYDEN. From 15 to 20 people.
Mr. VELDE. And the only one you remember, as I understand, isSteve Nelson?
Mr. HAYDEN. That is right.
Mr. VELDE. What was the subject of the conversation so far asSteve Nelson was concerned ?
Mr. HAYDEN. Yugoslavia. He asked questions about it and Italked about it.It was just a general conversation.
Mr. VELDE. Can you give in substance the conversation as youremember it?
Mr. HAYDEN. In capsule form, I would simply say I was the fellowwho was home from the wars, and I was a first-hand connection with,COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY157it, and therefore I was more or less the focal point of attention, andthis did not displease me, I must admit, and I went on and on aboutwhat I had seen in Yugoslavia.
Mr. VELDE. I guess Steve Nelson was particularly interested inyour story ?
Mr. HAYDEN. He didn't seem to be too much.
Mr. VELDE. Who did the most talking, Steve or you?
Mr. HAYDEN. I think it was split up among the entire party.
Mr. VELDE. Do you remember anybody else who was present at all,their first name?
Mr. HAYDEN. I am sorry; I do not. No names come to my mind.I think this was a very haphazard gathering, though I may be wrongabout that.
Mr. VELDE. I may have forgotten your testimony about "Pop"Folkoff. Where did you meet him ?
Mr. HAYDEN. In a restaurant.
Mr. VELDE. Was anybody else present at that meeting?
Mr. HAYDEN. I think we decided somebody named Baroway.
Mr. TAVENNER. Leo Baroway?
Mr. HAYDEN. I think so.
Mr. VELDE. Anybody else?
Mr. HAYDEN. Tompkins, Folkoff, this missing link, and myself.
Mr. VELDE. Was the restaurant on Marcus Street?
Mr. HAYDEN. I don't remember.
Mr. VELDE. What was the subject of the conversation?
Mr. HAYDEN. Just general conversation. We weren't discussingthe weather.
Mr. VELDE. I don't want to put you through the grill. I am inter-ested in finding out what the facts are.
Mr. HAYDEN. I appreciate that.I shouldn't have said generaldiscussion.
Mr. VELDE. In your associations with the Communist Party, whatdid they ask you about ? You had important information.
Mr. HAYDEN. It was more colorful than anything else.
Mr. VELDE. What was the general nature of the conversation?
Mr. HAYDEN. I am afraid of being redundant here. I can onlysay it was a description of what I had seen in Yugoslavia. Folkoffmaintained a very distant approach to the whole thing, smiled asthough he knew all about it. There were no points made; no line wasfollowed that I can recall in any way.
Mr. VELDE. Did he ask you about your experiences in Yugoslavia ?
Mr. HAYDEN. Yes. I don't think I needed to be asked at the time.It was like pressing a button and I was off to the races.
Mr. VELDE. How did you happen to make contact with Mr. Folkoff?
Mr. HAYDEN. Tompkins told me he wanted me to meet him.
Mr. VELDE. Where were you staying at that time ?
Mr. HAYDEN. On Tompkins' schooner.
Mr. VELDE. Was Tompkins the sole owner of the schooner?
Mr. HAYDEN. I think he and his wife.
Mr. VELDE. IS he a wealthy man?
Mr. HAYDEN. I would say he is anything but wealthy. I thinkthat-well, that is getting into the realm of conjecture again.
Mr. VELDE. There are degrees of being wealthy, like everythingelse.158COMMUNISMIN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY
Mr. HAYDEN. He is a man who had led a rather spectacular careerin the South Seas, in Europe, in Paris, as an artist and writer, andlie attempted to make the schooner pay and the schooner never paid..Ir. VELDE. You mean by taking passengers?
Mr. .\AYDEN. College boys in the summer; yes.
Mr. VELDE. You said he was one of those who influenced you to become a member of the Communist Party ?MIr. HAYDEN. He forged the first link, you might say.
Mr. VEDE. Did you attend any other parties or meetings while youwere in San Francisco?
Mr. HAYDEN. Yes; I may have, because all the time I was there therewere meetings going on, group gatherings and get-togethers.
Mr. VELDE. I mean in the schooner?
Mr. HAYDEN. Yes. People would come in the evenings and sit andtalk.
Mr. VELDE. Do you remember any of those people ?
Mr. HAYDEN. I remember one man who was apparently a closefriend of Tompkins. I subsequently heard he was in disrepute withthe party and had broken with it. He was a merchant seaman in thewar. I would remember his name if I heard it.
Mr. VELDE. Did you have occasion to meet Bernadette Doyle?
Mr. HAYDEN. Not to my knowledge.
Mr. VELDE. Louise Bransten?
Mr. HAYDEN. No.
Mr. VELDE. Do you know for a fact that Louise Bransten was notpresent at the meeting at the time you went to Dr. Lyman's home?
Mr. HAYDEN. She may have been. I know nothing about the name.It means nothing to me one way or the other.
Mr. VELDE. That is all.
Mr. WooD. General Kearney.
Mr. KEARNEY. Some few days ago there was testimony given byLarry Parks, and as I recollect he definitely stated that no writercould color a picture for propaganda purposes. Do you agree withthat ?
Mr. HAYDEN. I certainly do.
Mr. KEARNEY. That no writer could ?
Mr. HAYDEN. At the present time, with the feeling the way it is,I don't see how he could.
Mr. KEARNEY. How about the past ?
Mr. HAYDEN. I think there would be more chance in the past.
Mr. KEARNEY. It has been done in the past ?
Mr. HAYDEN. I think it has.
Mr. KEARNEY. Do you know if any of the 10 convicted Hollywoodactors have again been employed by the motion-picture industry?
Mr. HAYDEN. I have no idea. I assume they are not.
Mr. KEARNEY. I understood you to say in the meetings you attendedthere was discussion, indirectly, of the overthrow of the Governmentby force and violence?
Mr. HAYDEN. There was a discussion of what they called dialectics.
Mr. KEARNEY. Were any well-known leaders of the CommunistParty ever in attendance at any of the meetings you attended ?
Mr. HAYDEN. Not to my recollection.COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY159
Mr. KEARNEY. The name of Karen Morley has been injected herein your statement. Do you know whether she is still a member of theCommunist Party?
Mr. -IAYDEN. I 1ave no idea.
Mr. KEARNEY. You do know she was a member?
Mr. HAYDEN. I assume she was, because she tried to get me back intothe Communist Party.
Mr. KEARNEY. Only Communists would do that ?
Mr. HAYDEN. That is my view.
Mr. KEARNEY. That is all.
Mr. WooD. Mr. Jackson.
Mr. JACKSON. Do you know where Captain Tompkins is at thepresent time?
Mr. HAYDEN. He is in Los Angeles somewhere.
Mr. JACKSON. Have you received any communication from CaptainTompkins since you severed your connection with the party in 1946 ?
Mr. HAYDEN. Except for that time he came by the boat that Sundayafternoon, I have had no word from him at all.
Mr. JACKSON. Have you had any communication with Bea Winterssince you severed your connection with the Communist Party?
Mr. HAYDEN. I met her in a market when my wife was in thehospital with a baby. We had small talk there.
Mr. JACKSON. Have you had communication with Folkoff since yousevered your connection with the Communist Party ?
Mr. HAYDEN. No.
Mr. JACKSON. In your original contract with Paramount in 1940and 1941, who handled the negotiation for Paramount ?
Mr. HAYDEN. I assume Holman did.
Mr. JACKSON. Who was head of the contract department ?
Mr. HAYDEN.

Mr. HAYDEN. The same people.
Mr. JACKSON. Would you say those people in the motion-pictureindustry who have for some reason or other associated themselveswith the Communist Party or with front organizations, either as activemembers or as fellow travelers, lend their efforts to the party knowingthe ultimate goal of the front organizations for which they appear'.
Mr. HAYDEN. I think that covers a lot of ground. I certainlythink no, that the majority did not.
Mr. JACKSON. The majority did not?
Mr. HAYDEN. NO. I think that is particularly true of the Com-mittee for the First Amendment.
Mr. JACKSON. Did you do a picture in 1949 or 1950 called AsphaltJungle ?
Mr. HAYDEN. Yes.
Mr. JACKSON. Who was the producer ?160COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY
Mr. HAYDEN. Arthur Hornblow, Jr.
Mr. JACKSON. Who did the script ?
Mr. HAYDEN. John Huston andBen Madow.
Mr. JACKSON. Who directed it?
Mr. HAYDEN. John Huston.
Mr. JACKSON. After your discharge from service, did you at anytime go to the Communist Party headquarters in New York ?
Mr. HAYDEN. NO, I did not.
Mr. JACKSON. Or on the west coast ?
Mr. HAYDEN. I never did.
Mr. JACKSON. Did you at any time discuss politics with RussellHolman?
Mr. HAYDEN. No. I think Mr. Holman and Mr. Frank Freemanboth figured I was in the midst of a kind of-well, I don't want tooverwork the word "emotional," but that I was upset, and I think
Mr. Freeman was concerned, but thought it would dissipate itself.
Mr. JACKSON. Was Captain Tompkins personally acquainted withpeople in the movie colony ?
Mr. HAYDEN. Not to my knowledge. He once visited me on the set.
Mr. JACKSON. Did you attend any parties or affairs with CaptainTompkins in Hollywood?
Mr. HAYDEN. No; never did.
Mr. JACKSON. Was it ever intended that the story he was doing onyou was to be made into a script ?
Mr. HAYDEN. Not to my knowledge; not to my knowledge. Hehas had no experience in screen playwriting at all. I think he hadone idea in mind, which is the one I outlined. I have read randomremarks in trade papers that certain phases of my activity wouldmake a good story.
Mr. JACKSON. But whether he had that in mind, you don't know ?
Mr. HAYDEN. No, I don't.
Mr. JACKSON. You say Bea Winters is presently employed by aproducer?
Mr. HAYDEN. I have heard she is.
Mr. JACKSON. Do you know the producer's name ?
Mr. HAYDEN. I will think of it before I get through. I don't thinkof it now.
Mr. JACKSON.
Mr. HAYDEN.
Mr. JACKSON.
Mr. HAYDEN.
Mr. JACKSON.Do you know at what studio the producer is working?I think he is an independent producer.At what studioNo studio. They move around.During the period when you were a member of theparty, how many meetings would you say you attended?
Mr. HAYDEN. One a week for 3 months, which would give us 12,and probably after that 6 or 8.
Mr. JACKSON. During the period covered by your membership youare only able to identify 2 members of the cell by name?
Mr. HAYDEN. By name. I never knew their last names.That isthe gimmick in this thing. That was a thing that was carefullyguarded.
Mr. JACKSON. Do you know Herbert K. Sorrell ?
Mr. HAYDEN. I don't know him. I never met him. I know whohe is.COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY161
Mr. JACKSON. Were representations ever made to you regardingthe strike in Hollywood, representatives to assist in any way ?
Mr. HAYDEN. The whole focal point of the activity of this groupof actors and actresses was to swing the Screen Actors' Guild in favorof Sorrell's CSU.
Mr. JACKSON. Were you ever personally active in support of thestrike?
Mr. HAYDEN. I made a contribution to Polonsky which might beconstrued in support of it. Or it may have been for the party.
Mr. JACKSON. Did you ever attend meetings of any other cells ofthe Communist Party ?
Mr. HAYDEN. No, sir.
Mr. WooD. Excuse me. Is the name of the producer you werespeaking of, who is the employer of Bea Winters, Sam Spiegel?
Mr. HAYDEN. Yes. Thank you.
Mr. JACKSON. Do you think the goals of the Communist Party werein any way different at the time you were a member than they aretoday?
Mr. HAYDEN. I think the ultimate goal is the same.
Mr. JACKSON. Do you consider, Mr. Hayden, that in your ownmind you have been completely fair and completely frank with thecommittee, and that you have named for this committee every memberof the Communist Party in the moving-picture industry of whomyou have personal knowledge ?
Mr. HAYDEN. I do.
Mr. JACKSON. Mr. Hayden, has any member of your family, eitherby blood or marriage, at any time been a member of the CommunistParty?
Mr. HAYDEN. No; they certainly have not.
Mr. JACKSON. Thank you.
Mr. WooD. Mr. Potter.
Mr. Po'TER. Mr. Hayden, I was interested in the influence that thePartisan 'movement had on you, and I am wondering what yourobservation would be of that same influence on other Americans whohappened to be in OSS aiding the Partisan movement in Yugoslavia.Do you believe you were an exception or that other individuals closelyidentified with the Partisan movement would also be susceptible to the-Communist ideology through that association ?
Mr. HAYDEN. I can only say that to the best of my knowledge Iknow of no one else affected similarly. We were all deeply moved,but I have no way of knowing that anyone else had a parallelexperience.
Mr. PoTTER. Through your contact with other American militarypersonnel, did any of them at that time feel, or did you discuss amongyourselves, that communism was a political star which we should tieonto ?
Mr. HAYDEN. We never got into any of that.
Mr. POrrER. You never discussed that ?
Mr. HAYDEN. Not that I remember, not at all. All our work andconversation and thoughts seemed to be filled with just what was actually going on.
Mr. PorrTT.Do you have any knowledge at all of any effort duringthe last war to recruit military personnel into the Communist Party ?
Mr. HAYDEN. No; I have had no experience along that line.162COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY
Mr. POTTER. If I recall your testimony correctly, your cell instructedyou to contact this group, much larger group, of actors and actresses,-to get the guild to support the strike. Is that true ?
Mr. HAYDEN. Yes.
Mr. POTTER. In the cell meeting, did they tell you to go over and tomake certain contacts in the other organization and work throughthem ? Did they give any names of persons you were to work through ?
Mr. HAYDEN. I don't remember exactly. I know it was suggested Iattend that cocktail party, at which a large number of people werepresent. The suggestion was simply that I devote myself to thisactivity rather than the weekly meetings.
Mr. POTTER. Did you report back to the cell?
Mr. HAYDEN. I would go back once a month or so.
Mr. POTTER. TO report your progress?
Mr. HAYDEN. What was going on; yes.
Mr. POTTER. How successful were you with the other group ?
Mr. HAYDEN. I am sure, as a matter of fact, the move was very unsuccessful. It ran into the board of directors of the Screen Actors'Guild, and particularly into Ronald Reagan, who was a one-man battalion against this thing. He was very vocal and clear-thinking on it.I don't think many people realized how complex it was. I know Ididn't. There was very little headway made.
Mr. PoTTER. I know I would, and I assume the rest of the committeewould like to know the activities of a cell. We have had testimonyto indicate it is a coffee-and-doughnut society. You have indicatedpart of it was devoted to a discussion of Communist Party principles.What did you discuss? Did you discuss, for example, membership,how you could increase your membership ?
Mr. HAYDEN. That was frequently a subject of discussion, whetheranyone had ideas about new recruiting; who were near those beingrecruited; and things like that.
Mr. POTTER. What criteria did you have for knowing whether aperson was ready for the cell, or ripe to be plucked ?
Mr. HAYDEN. I never recruited anybody. I assume whenever theyfound somebody receptive to their theories, they would get him tocome to an open meeting, and in that way ask him to become an activemember.
Mr. PorrER. Would you say it is difficult to be a half-hearted member when you are a member of a cell?
Mr. HAYDEN. One of the most impressive things about that groupwas the dedication of the people to it.
Mr. POTTER. Was that through discipline ?
Mr. HAYDEN. I don't know how to answer that. As far as I know,there was little or no discipline.
Mr. PoTER. At the meetings of your cell group, did you discuss atany time means of financing front organizations ?I never heard that discussed.
Mr. HAYDEF.
Mr. PorrER. You never heard that discussed ?
Mr. HAYDEN. I never heard it discussed.
Mr. POTTER. And you have given the committee a list of contributions that you have made ?
Mr. HAYDEN. Yes.COMMUNISM INMOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY163
Mr. POTrER. I assume you have been solicited for many other con-tributions for organizations that are front organizations or Communist organizations, to which you did not give?
Mr. HAYDEN. I assume that is true. An actor is solicited for contributions all the time.
Mr. PorTER. An actor and a politician.
Mr. WOOD. Is that all, Mr. Potter ?
Mr. POTTER.Yes.
Mr. WooD. Did you have questions, Mr. Moulder ?
Mr. MOULDER. Yes.
Mr. WOOD. Proceed.
Mr. MOULDER. Referring to your testimony of the Communist movement having a tremendous effect on you following Yugoslavia, as Iunderstand, that was caused not because of your sympathy with theCommunist philosophy, but was stirred by the struggle of a minoritygroup seeking to achieve economic security ?
Mr. HAYDEN. No. The only thing we were struggling against wasthe Nazi occupation forces. We knew many of those people had beenunderground for years, but the one struggle we saw was against theGermans.
Mr. MOULDER. You were a member of the Communist Party only4 or 5 months ?
Mr. HAYDEN. Let's say 6 and be on the outside.
Mr. MOULDER. That was as a result of continual solicitation of anacquaintance of yours, and followed the exciting period you had encountered while in Yugoslavia ?
Mr. HAYDEN. I think that is right.
Mr. MOULDER. During the period of your membership in the party,you decided that the philosophy they were discussing was not in accord with your philosophy of government ?
Mr. HAYDEN. Yes. In the first place, if I may say so-and I say itbecause probably a good many people have been in a similar positionI never understood it. I was constantly told if I would read 40 pagesof Dialectical and Historical Materialism I would understand communism. I never got beyond page 8, and I tried. several times.
Mr. MOULDER. You resigned?
Mr. HAYDEN. I quit.
Mr. MOULDER. And severed all connections with the CommunistParty?
Mr. HAYDEN. That I did.
Mr. MOULDER. That was several years ago ?
Mr. HAYDEN. Over 4 years ago.
Mr. MOULDER. It is my understanding that the request for yourappearance before this committee was not in the spirit of any reflection on or any doubt of your loyalty to our country, but it was aneffort on the part of the committee to secure information regardingCommunist activities.
Mr. HAYDEN. That is the way it seems to me.
Mr. MOULDER. I believe your courageous services in the MarineCorps and in the OSS deserve commendation, and your testimony inmy opinion has been straightforward and honest.
Mr. HAYDEN. Thank you.81595-51-pt. 1---8164COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY
Mr. MOULDER. From the testimony adduced here before this com-mittee, I can reach only one conclusion, so far as I am concerned, andthat is that you have joined with us in our efforts to expose the evilsof communism: that you are an intensely loyal American citizen andyou deserve commendation for the services you have rendered as aMarine Corps soldier and for your testimony before this committee.
Mr. WooD. Mr. Doyle, do you have further questions ?
Mr. DOYLE. Yes. May I be permitted to ask three or four morequestions that I deferred asking before so that my colleagues could asktheir questions?I think you said in 1944 "It built up a tremendous curiosity. Something was going on in the world that I wanted to find out about." Doyou recall so testifying ?
Mr. HAYDEN. Yes.
Mr. DOYLE. What was there going on in the world that you wantedto find out about that built up such a curiosity ? Did you find out ?
Mr. HAYDEN. I think I, found out to my complete satisfaction.Isimply had never thought of the conflicting forces in the world before.
Mr. DOYLE. What did you find out that satisfied that curiositythat had come to the surface, I think you said, in 1944 ?
Mr. HAYDEN. You mean the curiosity arose in 1944?
Mr. DOYLE. I think that was the substance of your language. Yousaid one time you went to see Tompkins and it built up a tremendouscuriosity that something was going on in the world that you wantedto find out about.
Mr. HAYDEN. That is right.
Mr. DOYLE. Why did you go to Tompkins to find out what was goingon in the world?
Mr. HAYDEN. It so happened he came to me. I think it is one ofthe characteristics of our country and of all democracies that as arule we don't endeavor to impress upon people-I think we don't attempt to do it enough-the things we believe in. Communists are the.opposite. They give you no peace. When a Communist like Tompkins finds anyone at all susceptible, the pressure is on unremittingly.
Mr. DOYLE. Did you find anything going on in the world as to theactivities of the Communist Party in relation to what was going onin America or other freedom-loving nations, and if so, what?
Mr. HAYDEN. Only that this whole totalitarian Communist move isa tremendous force in the world.
Mr. DOYLE. When you refer to this totalitarian movement, what isthat movement, in your judgment?
Mr. HAYDEN. An endeavor to take over the entire world.
Mr. DOYLE. Are you testifying now that the intention and purposeof the Communist Party of the United States is to, by force, takecontrol of the United States of America Government?
Mr. HAYDEN. Yes; I do.
Mr. DOYLE. What was your answer?
Mr. HAYDEN. Yes.
Mr. DOYLE. You haven't been a member of the Communist Partysince 1948?
Mr. HAYDEN. 1946.
Mr. DOYLE. Since 1946. Was that your firm conclusion and opin-ion at the time you resigned from the Communist Party of the UnitedStates ?COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY165
Mr. HAYDEN. Yes; it was.
Mr. DOYLE. Is it still your opinion
Mr. HAYDEN. Yes; it is.
Mr. DOYLE. But you were solicited in 1947 to rejoin the CommunistParty, were you not?
Mr. HAYDEN. I was.
Mr. DOLE. What inducements, if any, were given you at that timeto rejoin the Communist Party? 'What arguments were put 'up toyou ?
Mr. HAYDEN. There was very little argument. One thing I learnedwas that you can't argue with a Communist. His mind is made up, andyou can talk from now to breakfast and it won't do any good.
Mr. DOYLE. Have you been solicited by anyone but Karen Morley:since 1947 to rejoin the Communist Party?
Mr. HAYDEN. I have not; not at all.
Mr. DOYLE. I am going to ask you this question. I don't know ifit was asked by any other member of the committee when I went tothe floor to vote or not. You are here before a committee of theUnited States Congress, a duly constituted committee of the Houseof Representatives, every Member of which is elected every 2 yearsby the American people. What is your opinion of the jurisdiction,the purpose, the functioning of this committee, before which you havetestified 3 hours today ? Is it, in your judgment, serving a useful purpose? Is it serving a necessary purpose? If so, to what extent, andif not, why ? Is that a fair question ?
Mr. HAYDEN. Yes.
Mr. DOYLE. I am really asking for your honest-to-God truthfulopinion. I have never asked that question before, but I think in view.of the manner in which you have come before this committee, and theapparent frankness with which you have answered questions, if you:have any criticism of the manner in which this committee functions,I would like to know what that criticism is. You have now been be-fore us 3 hours.
Mr. HAYDEN. I think of no criticism whatever.
Mr. DOYrE. Have you any suggestions to make of ways and meansin which we might be more helpful in meeting this problem of the-determination of the Communist Party of the United States to over:throw, if necessary by force, our Government ?
Mr. HAYDEN. I think that the request and suggestion that was madeby the chairman of the committee, of which I was apprised by thecounsel of the committee, that people come up and speak up, is thething I came here today thinking it was an extremely fine thing, a con-structive thing.I don't mean to attach any importance to myself as an individualwho is out of balance, but I have had the feeling that my appearancebefore the committee could serve a very useful purpose. I hope it does.
Mr. DOYLE. Thank you.
Mr. WooD. Mr. Velde, did you have additional questions?
Mr. VELDE. Yes. Referring back to your trip back to the States-when you said there were several parties in San Francisco, do younow recall any other people that you met at these parties?
Mr. HAYDEN. I thought of the name of this merchant seaman I said-was expelled. His first name is Jim.
Mr. VELDE. He has been expelled from the Communist Party ?166COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY
Mr. HAYDEN. I heard he was, subsequently.
Mr. VELDE. Did you ever meet Steve Murin ?Nt by that name.
Mr. VELDE. Did you ever meet Dwight Freeman?
Mr. HAYDEN. I know that name. Did he have another first name ?I know a man named Freeman.
Mr. VELDE. I think he is also known as James Freeman. This was
Mr.HAYDEN.brought out in the prior Hawaiian hearings. Do you feel that theFreeman you met in San Francisco, or knew, was a member of theCommunist Party ?
Mr. HAYDEN. I really don't have any idea. Tompkins got me tosee a man named Freeman who, I think, was a lithographer, or en-gaged in printing of some kind, in some way.It seems to me hisfirst name was Bud, but I have no opinion at all on the question whichyou ask.
Mr. VELDE. Did you meet Freeman's wife Pearl?
Mr. HAYDEN. Not to my knowledge.
Mr. VELDE. I believe you said you came in to New York and thencame to Washington?
Mr.HAYDEN. Yes.
Mr. VELDE. Did you contact any member of theCommunist Party,or did any member of the Communist Party contact you, here inWashington ?
Mr. HAYDEN. Not at all that I know of.
Mr. VELDE. How long were you here?
Mr. HAYDEN. I think the total leave was 5 weeks.
Mr. VELDE. I mean here in Washington.
Mr. HAYDEN. I suppose half of that time, 21/2 weeks.
Mr. VELDE. You spent some time in Los Angeles, too, didn't you?
Mr. HAYDEN. I came through Los Angeles and made a couple phonecalls. I called Mr. Freeman at Paramount, just to say hello. I neverleft the airport, as I remember it.
Mr. VELDE. Going back to the Yugoslavia operations as a memberof the OSS, what do you feel was the general attitude of the OSS toward the Partisan movement?
Mr. HAYDEN. That is an involved matter.
Mr. VELDE. I realize that.
Mr. HAYDEN. The feeling was high and strong. I was only associated with the Partisans. One man, named Gov' Muslin, I methim on leave, and he was pro-Mihailovitch. There was every shadeof opinion.
Mr. VELDE. Did OSS members, including yourself, have any contact with the Chetniks?
Mr. HAYDEN. Yes.
Mr. VELDE. What was the attitude of the OSS toward the Chetniks?
Mr. HAYDEN. Until Tito merged, I think we were following theBritish dictate, which was to support Mihailovitch and the Chetniks.
Mr. VELDE. Wasn't the attitude of the OSS members at that timeto belittle the efforts of the Chetniks ?
Mr. HAYDEN. No. There was a certain element of OSS officerswho, I believe were pro-Mihailovitch and stayed that way. Othersstarted that way and swung to Tito.
Mr. VELDE. Have you ever met a man named Eric Cogill?
Mr. HAYDEN. I have never heard the name.COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY167
Mr. VELDE. Have you ever met, to your recollection, any memberof the Soviet consulate at San Francisco, or the Soviet consulate atLos Angeles, or the Soviet Embassy in Washington ?
Mr. HAYDEN. Certainly not of the Soviet Embassy in Washington,or of the Soviet consulate in Los Angeles, though it is possible I met.a member of the Embassy in San Francisco, though I do not remember.
Mr. VELDE. Would you remember if I mentioned his name ?
Mr. HAYDEN. There is only one way to find out. If the name rings:any bell I will say that it does.
Mr. VELDE. Have you ever met Gregory Kheifets ?
Mr. HAYDEN. No.
Mr. VEDzE. Then to the best of your recollection you have nevermet a member of the Soviet diplomatic force in the United States?
Mr. HAYDEN. Not to the best of my recollection.
Mr. WOOD. General Kearney.
Mr. KEARNEY. I have just been informed that counsel is going tostraighten out what I had proposed to question him about.
Mr. WoOD. Anything further?
Mr. JACKSON. Were any representations made to you to appear before the committee and give testimony ?
Mr. HAYDEN. I was subpenaed to appear before the committee.
Mr. JACKSON. There were no representations made by the industryor anybody in the industry ?
Mr. HAYDEN. NO.
Mr. JACKSON. Were any representations made to you at any timenot to appear before the committee?
Mr. HAYDEN. No, sir.
Mr. JACKSON. You have not been approached by any person toappear or not to appear before the committee ?
Mr. HAYDEN. Not in any way.
Mr. WooD. Mr. Potter.
Mr. POTTER; Have you been in contact with, or have you met, anyof the members of your particular cell since you left the party?
Mr. HAYDEN. Outside of the day that I bumped into Bea Wintersin the market, I don't believe I have ever even seen a member of thatcell.
Mr. POTTER. How does it happen that Bea Winters was the one whotalked you into becoming a member of the party when your goodfriend, Captain Tompkins, was the one who constantly advocated theCommunist cause ? Why didn't Captain Tompkins approach you tobecome a member instead of Bea Winters ?
Mr. HAYDEN. I can only imagine he was waiting for a tacticalapproach. And he was living in another district.
Mr. POTTER. You stated that you were the only actor in your cell?
Mr. HAYDEN. That is correct.
Mr. POTTER. Did you have any liaison with other Communist cellsin Hollywood ?,
Mr. HAYDEN. None whatsoever.
Mr. POTTER. You knew that other actors were members of theCommunist Party? You didn't feel you were alone?
Mr. HAYDEN. I have some comment on that. When I joined I wasunder the impression, perhaps erroneously, that there were a goodmany name actors in the party. Now, what is "name"actor?
Mr. POTTER. Your cell was composed of technicians ?168COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRYI heard it said once that it was too bad a small,select group of actors could not be formed, but for some reason itcould not be formed.
Mr. PorTER. From the testimony that you have given before thecommittee, and the forthright maimer in which you have given thetestimony, do you expect any reprisals from this testimony by themotion-picture industry ?
Mr. HAYDEN. Yes.
Mr. HAYDEN. I do not.I have thought about that.I will befrank, I have thought about it. Whether it is natural wishful thinking or confidence, I don't know, but I feel that when the mistake of 5.months is weighed against other things, I really don't see anyjustification for it.
Mr. POTER. And I assume from that, that the people in the motion-picture industry knew about it?
Mr. HAYDEN. I would disagree with that. I was subpenaed to appear before this committee approximately 5 days before I started:working in the picture in which I am now engaged. At that time therewas considerable consternation on the part of producers, simply because I had been subpenaed. They asked that I issue a statementdenying past or present afiliation. I issued a statement denyingpresent affiliation.
Mr. POTTER. So you think it came as a distinct surprise to them?
Mr. HAYDEN. I think today's testimony will come as quite a surprise.
Mr. POTtER. When Mr. Parks was here recently he said he belongedto a select group of actors. You had no knowledge of that while youwere a member of the party ?
Mr. HAYDEN. I was under the impression no such group existed.
Mr. POTTER. And you were surprised when you heard that testimonyof Mr. Parks?
Mr. HAYDEN. I was. I never had a firm opinion about Larry Parks..I did not know. I know in these meetings of actors occasionally itwould be suggested that perhaps Parks would support something, andit was always said, "No; he would not." I remember that clearly.
Mr. PorrER. I have no further questions.
Mr. WooD. Mr. Hayden, what, if anything, do you know about anyfund-raising activities in Los Angeles for the benefit of the Communist movement, while you were connected with it?
Mr. HAYDEN. I know nothing about that except there was one checkI wrote for Abe Polonsky, but on whose behalf, I have no information:on that.
Mr. WOOD. Through Communist channels have you any information?
Mr. HAYDEN. No, none.
Mr. Woon. You never heard that discussed at any meetings you attended ?
Mr. HAYDEN. I never did.
Mr. WooD. I believe you said that during the time you belonged to*the party you had weekly meetings, at least for 3 or 4 months of thattime?
Mr. HAYDEN. That is right.
Mr. WOOD. And that those weekly meetings were attended by from10 to 20 or more eople?
Mr. HAYDEN.Ves.COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY169
Mr. WOOD. Those meetings were not publicized ?
Mr. HAYDEN. No; on the contrary.
Mr. WooD. They were surreptitiously held?
Mr. HAYDEN. Yes.
Mr. WOOD. And you knew other people were meeting surrepti-tiously and discussing whatever matters were discussed
Mr. HAYDEN. Yes.
Mr. WOOD. And you are telling the committee that notwithstandingthese meetings of three or four times a month with that group ofpeople, meeting in secret at the homes of individuals, you never gotsufficiently familiar with the identity of any of those people to be ableto enlighten the committee as to the identity of any but the two orthree you have stated
Mr. HAYDEN. That is the case.
Mr. Woon. It never occurred to you to make any inquiry aboutit?
Mr. HAYDEN. It did not. I think I can say, in regard to that,that shortly after I began to proceed in this, I became aware of thefact that I had to set my own house in order, that I had to get myselfout of it, and my feeling was quite strong on that until I got myselfunder control.
Mr. WOOD. But you did realize, before your separated yourselffrom the movement, that it was not the character of movement youwanted to be connected with?
Mr. HAYDEN. That is'right.
Mr. WooD. And even so, you leave with this committee the im-pression you did not get sufficiently curious about your associates toinquire as to who they were
Mr. HAYDEN. That is right.
Mr. WooD. And you cannot tell us a single name of others in thatcell
Mr. HAYDEN. I cannot.
Mr. WooD. Anything further?
Mr. VELDE. Did you attend a Progressive Party rally at MadisonSquare Garden in 1947 ?"Mr.HAYDEN. At which Mr. Wallace spoke? Yes.
Mr. VELDE. Whom did you go there with
Mr. HAYDEN. My wife, who ishere today.
Mr. VELDE. Was there anyone else in your group ?
Mr. HAYDEN. I am strongly of the impression we went alone.
Mr. VELDE. Did you meet any persons at that rally you can identifyas being members of the Communist Party
Mr. HAYDEN. To the best of my recollection we went in, sat down,got out of the meeting, and left.
Mr. VELDE. How long did you stay in New York on that occasion
Mr. HAYDEN. I think we stayed 2 or 3 days. It was on our wayhome from the coast of Maine to California.
Mr. VELDE. During that time you didn't meet or talk with anymembers of the Communist Party who were known to you to bemembers of the Communist Party?
Mr. HAYDEN. I don't think I met anyone of any political natureat all.
Mr. VELDE. Can you tell the committee what prompted you to at-tend that rally170COMMUNISMINMOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY
Mr. HAYDEN. I think I can. As I said, the entire year of 1947 Iwas not working. I was under contract, but I did not work. I stayedon the boat in Santa Barbara. I was married in May of that yearand my wife and I went East for - months. Then I began to feela desire to at least participate in something of a constructive nature.We were in New Y ork on our way to the west coast when this rallywas being held.
Mr. VELDE. Here had you come from before you went to the rallyin New York?
Mr. HAYDEN. Maine. Then we went out to California, and it wasthat same feeling that motivated me in joining the Committee forthe First Amendment when I was approached. It was a desire totalk about something outside the weather, which was what we hadbeen talking about all summer in Maine.
Mr. WooD. Mr. Doyle.
Mr. DOYLE. The law under which this counittee functions, as faras jurisdiction is concerned, provides that we may inquire into theextent, character, and objects of un-American propaganda activitiesin the United States. Have you any information which you cangive this committee which you have not already given on that subject? If you have, will you give it to us, please? Do you understand my question ?
Mr. HAYDEN. Yes.I believe that I have covered just about every-thing I possibly have access to in my own mind.
Mr. DOYLE. The law also provides that we shall inquire into thedistribution and diffusion within the United States of subversive andun-American propaganda that is instigated by and comes from foreigncountries. Have you any information on that?
Mr. HAYDEN. I have no information on that whatsoever.
Mr. DOYLE. Did you acquire any information on that while you werea member?
Mr. HAYDEN. I did not.
Mr. DOYLE. Or before or at all?
Mr. HAYDEN. No.
Mr. DOYLE. You have testified twice, in answer to my questions,that you are satisfied one of the objectives of the Communist Partyof the United States is to forcibly overthrow, if necessary, the form ofgovernment set out by our American Constitution. Have you anything to add as to the ways and means they would undertake to accomplish that objective?
Mr. HAYDEN. I do not.
Mr. DoYLE. Thank you.
Mr. TAVENNER. I want to make certain that your testimony isclear in regard to one matter. I asked you to name those whom youknow to be members of the Communist Party who were connected withthe Screen Actor's Guild with which you worked, and you namedthose that you knew ?
Mr. HAYDEN. I did.
Mr. TAVENNER. And you named several others, members of theCommunist Party, with which you had come in contact. Then, inthe course of your testimony, you indicated that you could name others,but it would be a matter of conjecture, and I stated to you that I didnot want you to testify from conjecture. Have you given to the in-171COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRYvestigators of this committee a list of names of those to whom youhave referred ?
Mr. HAYDEN. Yes, I have.
Mr. TAVENNER. That is all.
Mr. WooD. By that I understand that the list of names you havegiven the investigators are in addition to those you have named beforethis committee.
Mr. HAYDEN. Yes, they are.
Mr. WooD. And do I understand those names have been furnishedthe investigators by you only upon some conjecture you have thatthey may have been members of the party ?
Mr. HAYDEN. My feeling is that the only ones I know to have beenmembers are those active in the cell and Karen Morley.would have to be conjecture.Any others
Mr. WooD. That is not entirely responsive to my question.Do Iunderstand that the list of names you have furnished the investigators,that you have no knowledge as to whether they have ever been members of the Communist Party or not?
Mr. HAYDEN. That is true. I do not know.
Mr. WOOD. But your purpose in furnishing the list of names to theinvestigators was that by proper investigation on the part of the investigators of the committee and the committee itself, that their connection with the Communist Party might be revealed with reference tosome of them?
Mr. HAYDEN. I think if they were asked it would be developed.
Mr. WooD. Was that your purpose in furnishing to the staff ofthis committee that list of names ?
Mr. HAYDEN. It was.
Mr. WooD. And no other reason?
Mr. HAYDEN. No, sir.
Mr. DOYLE. May I ask one more question: Did you testify thatKaren Morley was a member of the cell?
Mr. HAYDEN. She was not a member of the cell.
Mr. WooD. The committee will adjourn until 10 o'clock tomorrowmorning.(Thereupon, at 1:15 p. m. on Tuesday, April 10, 1951, an adjournment was taken until Wednesday, April 11, 1951, at 10 a. m.)COMMUNIST INFILTRATION OF HOLLYWOOD MOTIONPICTURE INDUSTRY-PART 1WEDNESDAY, APRIL 11, 1951UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,COMMITTEE ON UN-AMERICAN ACTIVrTlES,Washingto',D.

Wheeler, investigator; John W. Carrington, clerk; andA. S. Poore, editor.
Mr. WOOD. I will ask that the people in the audience please refrainfrom audible conversation during the hearings.' Mr. Counsel, are you ready to proceed
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Chairman, I'would like to give Mr. Martin.IPopper, an attorney from New York, an opportunity to make a motion.before the committee at this time.
Mr. PorrPE. Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, I repre:sent Mr. J. Edward Bromberg.
Mr. WooD. For the purposes of identification, will you give yourname and address ?
Mr. POPPER. Martin Popper, 160 Broadway, New York.
Mr. Bromberg has been subpenaed to appear before this committeetomorrowmorning. I have submitted to the counsel for the committeea number of medical documents indicating the serious condition of
Mr. Bromberg's health, and at his suggestion I am now making aformal application to have Mr. Bromberg's subpena vacated on theground of serious physical condition.
Mr. Bromberg is a victim of heart disease, having suffered a heart-attackwithin the past month, and as the medical certificates submittedto Mr. Tavenner indicate, Mr. Bromberg would be in serious danger,of suffering another heart attack under any kind of anxiety, underany kind--Mr. WooD. Have you the certificate?
Mr. PoPPEm. Yes; I do. I have already submitted photostaticcopies.
Mr. Woon Suppose you read the certificates you have.173174COMMUNISM INMOTION-PICTURE
Mr. POPPER. There are two.INDUSTRYThe first is from Dr. Walter Modell,a distinguished heart specialist of New York, under whose care Mr.Bromberg presently is, who says:
Mr. J. Edward Bromberg has asked me to write to you. Mr. Bromberg hasrheumatic heart disease. He first visited me because of this in August 1944,and since he has taken residence in this city I have attended him regularly forit. Mr. Bromberg discovered that he had rheumatic heart disease in his youth.The exact time it developed has not been established. Since its discovery anduntil recently his heart disease has been well compensated and he has requiredno treatment. Since December of 1950 he has complained of symptoms ofcardiac dysfunction. This was treated with mercurial diuretics with relief.In March 1951, in Philadelphia, he suffered a frank attack of congestive failure.This was treated with digitalis and mercurial diuretics. This form of treatment has been continued, and Mr. Bromberg is now symptom free. Treatmentand dietary restriction will be required for an indefinite period. I have alsoadvised Mr. Bromberg to refrain from emotional upsets and to avoid tensionsand anxieties. There is the possibility that unless this practice is followed therewill be further attacks of heart failure.I also have a certificate from the physician at Philadelphia whotreated Mr. Bromberg at the time of his heart attack within the pastmonth, and if the committee wants me to, I shall be glad to read thatas well, but it merely confirms that fact and indicates the course oftreatment.I am also ready to present to the committee the electrocardiographstaken of Mr. Bromberg's condition in March of 1951 at the time ofthe heart attack, for which attack and general symptoms he is stillunder treatment.I would under these circumstances suggest that reason and safetyitself would indicate the correctness of vacating the subpena, acourse which is followed even in its most normal sense even in judicialproceedings of a kind which don't bring in this kind of anxiety.
Mr. WALTER. Do those affidavits go so far as to express the opinionthat if your client appears his health and his life would be endangered ?
Mr. POPPER. There is no question but thatMr. WALTER. Do the affidavits say that?
Mr. POPPER. First of all, they are not affidavits, sir.They aremedical certificates. It says that any kind of emotional upset oranxiety create the possibility of a further heart attack at this time.There is no doubt in my mind that any inquiry of any of thesephysicians, because they have already been asked this question, wouldindicate that an appearance before this committee at this time leadsto the definite danger of a heart attack, with whatever serious andterrible consequences may come therefrom.I should imagine, Congressman Walter, that under these circumstances the gravity of the responsibility on any public body is immeasurable.
Mr. WALTER. We realize that, except I know, having practiced lawfor a great many years, that you can get doctors to make statementsas to almost anything, and even though those statements don't go sofar as to indicate that this man's health would be endangered by anappearance hereMr. POPPER. Not quite.I mean as far as these certificates areconcerned. In the first place, I offered to the committee the electrocardiographs of Mr. Bromberg, and as a matter of fact I have alreadyindicated to Mr. Tavenner that we haven't the slightest objection toCOMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY175any check being made on this by anybody that the committee seesfit.
Mr. WOOD. Let's see if I get that statement correctly. Say it again.
Mr. POPPER. I have already indicated to Mr. Tavenner at the timeof the submission of the certificates that we haven't the slightestobjection to your making your check as to the accuracy of thesecertificates.
Mr. WOOD. If the committee approves, we will continue the subpenain force for 30 days, to give us an opportunity to make a further investigation about it.
Mr. POPPER. By all means. I have no objection at all. Does thecommittee want the document?
Mr. WOOD. File it, please.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Chairman, I think I should ask counsel a question or two, since he has appeared here. I would like to know whetheror not the witness is employed and working at the present time.
Mr. POPPER. He is not.
Mr. TAVENNER. I should state to the committee what I have done inconnection with this matter, which of course has been very little, inview of the work that is piled upon the staff at the present moment.I have had copies of these certificates since Saturday, and I wascalled on the phone by counsel a day or two prior to that and I madethe suggestion at the time that in a matter of this kind I would want tomake a very thorough investigation, and he cooperated in every wayabout the making ofthat investigation. We have not had the opportunity to make it. However, at the time of service on March 7 thewitness was engaged in the production of a play and was served at thetheater.
Mr. DOYLE. Nighttime or daytime?
Mr. TAVENNER. I don't know the hour, but it is the play, Springtime for Henry, which was playing at the time. Effort has been madeto serve him at his home, unsuccessfully, and I want to investigate allthe circumstances about that, as well as the medical situation.
Mr. POPPER. By all means. However, Mr. Chairman, I think thereare one or two implications that are unfair. In the first place, Mr.Bromberg is an actor. In the second place, he couldn't have beenserved at his home, since he was opening in a play at Baltimore, where"he was served at that time. The heart attack of which these certificates speak, occurred after the time of service. They occurred several-weeks thereafter.
Mr. RUSSELL. He was served in Wilmington, Del., at the DuPont.
Mr. TAVENNER. He was served in Wilmington after several attempts-over several days in order to make the service. We have here the investigator to testify if necessary.
Mr. POPPER. I think it is fair to tell the committee the place inWilmington where he was served.
Mr. RUSSELL. Put Mr. Jones, committee investigator, on. He served-him at the DuPont Hotel in Wilmington, Del.
Mr. WooD. I don't think it is necessary to go further into it. In lightof the statements here, I feel that the staff should make further investigation, and we will undertake to designate some physician. I assumethat you, Mr. Popper, will be cooperative with us in having him.examined.
Mr. POPPER. Of course. I have already indicated that to counsel.176COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY
Mr. WOOD. If it develops he is unable to come here for that purpose,the committee will take under advisement the question of sending a.subcommittee up to his place to take his testimony.
Mr. TAVENNER. I would like to call Mr. Marc Lawrence.
Mr. MADDEN. Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, I amMurdaugh S. Madden, a Washington attorney, 1830 Jefferson PlaceNW. I represent Mr. Lawrence. He is under subpena to appeartoday and is persently in a sanitarium in Alhambra, Calif.I first contacted the committee through Mr. Tavenner on that matterabout 10 days ago, and at that time I had not myself verified his condition. I went out there and satisfied myself that he physically couldnot appear at this time and checked with his doctors and got doctors'statements, which I have with me today.I am not asking that the committee vacate the subpena. The man'scondition is such and can readily be verified as such that if it would bepossible for the committee to take testimony there at the sanitarium.or at his home, if he is in his home, within a reasonable time in thefuture, that is the request that I would like to make now.
Mr. WOOD. How long in your opinion would it be before he would'be able to come here?
Mr. MADDEN. When I left California 4 days ago the doctors thoughtthat it would be maybe 2 to 3 weeks. I got word yesterday thathe had since been sent to the sanitarium, and the doctors now will notsay when he might improve. His is a mental and physical break-down that is bordering on complete breakdown at this time, as Iunderstand it.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Chairman, when counsel got in touch with me-about it, we endeavored to have our investigators who were then in,California make some check of this matter. They were unable to.,locate the physicians at the time, or the witness. We have found outlater that the witness had gone out into the country where he couldbe alone, but we have not been able at this time to make a check ofthe medical facts reported here or to interview the doctors in theshort period of time which we have to work on it. For that reason,.we feel that we should have a sufficient amount of time to investi--gate it.
Mr. WooD. Supposing we continue the subpena in force for a periodof 2 weeks and in that time get some definite statement from the physician if we possibly can and submit it to counsel for the committeehere, and we will be able to take appropriate action and notify you..what is desired.
Mr. MADDEN. Thank you. I would like to repeat the request thatif it appears that he will'then be in no condition to come if it wouldbe possible for a subcommittee or some other type of questioning to.be taken out there. He is fully prepared to answer completely and.honestly all the questions of the committee.
Mr. WOOD. I am sure the committee will explore that possibilityand take whatever action it thinks the circumstances will warrant.
Mr. MADDEN. Thank you.
Mr. DoYLE. May I ask this question, Mr. Chairman, of counsel::Would his doctors stipulate that he was physically able to testify outthere, or would we be confronted with a surprise statement by a doctorout there that he wasn't physically able to testify there either; if hishealth was so bad ?COMMUNISM INMOTION-PICTUREIDUSTRY177M1r. MADDEN. No, Mr. Doyle. I think that it is possible that thequestioning might be similar to the questioning that I had to conductlast week, which was very tenuous and took a great deal of time, but1 am sure that if the man is alive he will submit to questioning.
Mr. DOYLE. Thank you very much.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Chairman, I would like to call Mr. Will Geer.
Mr. WooD. Is Mr. Geer present ?

Mr. GEER. I don't understand that question, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. I said did you furnish any references to those stu-dios in connection with your employment in those two contracts?
Mr. GEER. I have been in the theater for about 25 years,-sir. Ithink I am well enough known to all of them from the roles I. haveplayed.
Mr. TAVENNER. You felt that was not necessary?
Mr. GEER. I don't believe so; no.
Mr. TAVENNER. Have you ever furnished references to the studioswith which you sought to make contracts ?
Mr. GEER. No.I think a person's work is usually the judge ofwhether you get a part or not.
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes; after 25 years; but you have to have a beginning place, some place along the line. So I am asking you if at anytime you did that.
Mr. GEER. Well, I don't believe so. It is always a question of whichcomes first, the hen or the egg, about an actor getting a job. Youget the job or the egg or the hen which hatches first.- Mr. TAVENNER. Will you answer my question as to whether or notyou furnished references to any studio in connection with your employment?
Mr. GEER. No; I never felt it necessary, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you do it?
Mr. GEER. No.
Mr. TAVENNER. Whether you felt it necessary or not, did you ?
Mr. GEER. No. We just make an appearance and we are soldlikeMr. TAVENNER. How long have you lived in California?
Mr. GEER. The last 21/2 years, in Santa Monica.
Mr. TAVENNER. And prior to that time where did you live ?
Mr. GEER. I have a farm in Rockland County, in the Hudson Valley,New York State.
Mr. TAVENNER. And how long did you live in New York State?
Mr. GEER. Ten years. Long enough to get the farm, the home. Itis a blueberry farm.
Mr. TAVENNER. How long were you in the State of New York inthe theatrical profession ?
Mr. GEER. Well, I would say off and on. Of course, New York is acenter of show business, so we naturally gravitate there for jobs. Iimagine since the year 1924 I have gone to New York off and on.Sometimes you would go on tour all over the country, and again wewould be in New York.
Mr. TAVENNER. First I will ask you whether you were living in theState of New York in 1942?
Mr. GEER. 1942. I imagine so: Let's see. I was campaigning forWendell Willkie along about that time. I don't know whether it was1942 or not. No, Wendell Willkie died.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you also interested at that time in the Communist Party, as indicated by your signing of a Communist Partyindependent nominating petition July 23, 1942?81595-51-pt. 1-9180COMMUNISMINMOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY
Mr. GEER. 1942?
Mr. TAVENNER. I hand you a photostatic copy of what purports. tobe such a petition.
Mr. GEER. Well, that, gentlemen, is an emotional, hysterical ques-tion based on the date. I stand on my rights, the fifth amendment, onthe grounds it might incriminate or degrade me.
Mr. TAVENNER. I ask you again to look at the Communist Partynominating petition which I hand you and state whether or not thename Will Geer appears on that petition, and if so whether or not it isyour signature.
Mr. GEER. I stand on the same grounds.
Mr. TAVENNER. I desire to file the document in evidence and askthat it be marked "Geer Exhibit No. 1."(The document referred to above was marked "Geer Exhibit No. 1.)1
Mr. GEER. 1942? This is 1951. Actors are so gabby, I beg fourpardon.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you a member of the Communist Party in1942?
Mr. GEER. I stand on the grounds of the fifth amendment.
Mr. TAVENNER. What do you mean you stand on the grounds of thefifth amendment?
Mr. GEER. Well, it might incriminate or degrade me. The word"Communist" is an emotional, hysterical word of the day, like theword "witch" in Salem.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you refusing to answer the question because youconsider it an emotional and hysterical matter ? Is that the groundsof your refusal, or is it some other ground ?
Mr. GEER. On the grounds of tending to incriminate.
Mr. TAVENNER. In other words, you are refusing to answer thequestion because to do so might tend to incriminate you ?
Mr. GEER. Incriminate.
Mr. TAVENNER. And you place your refusal to answer squarely uponthat ground ?
Mr. GEER. Upon that ground.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you state to the committee the basis for yourrefusal to answer that question or give the committee some information upon which it may judge whether or not to answer that questionmight tend to incriminate you?
Mr. GEER. I answered that question on the advice of counsel andrefused it.
Mr. TAVENNER. So you refuse to furnish any information to thecommittee upon which it may act or judgeAr. GEER. That's correct.
Mr. TAVENNER (continuing). The requirement of your answeringthat question?I have before me an issue of October 20, 1936, of the Daily Worker,in which there is an article under the title "Miner Talks in the BronxTomorrow." In the body of this article appears this language:All the members and friends of the Jewish Bureau of the Communist Partyand the Furriers Union which have endorsed Gold's candidacy have been askedto attend this meeting, the Bronx County Committee of the Communist Partyannounced. Chairman of the meeting will be Harry Yerris, county secretary,1Retained in committee files.COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY181who will open the gathering with brief introductory remarks. In addition to thespeaking, an elaborate program has been arranged, featuring Will Geer.Do you recall that meeting?
Mr. GEER. I refuse to answer the question on the same grounds ofthe fifth amendment, because. it is an emotional question, out of date.
Mr. TAVENNER. IS your answer based upon the date of the docu-ment ? Is that the basis of your refusal?
Mr. GEER. On the grounds of the fifth amendment, as I have already stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Then place your refusal on the grounds that youactually rely upon.I have before me the September 25, 1945, issue of the Daily Worker,in which there appears an article entitled "Thousand Artists, WritersBack Davis," and I read as follows:Formation of an artists, writers, and professionals group for the election ofBenjamin J. Davis was announced yesterday by Paul Robeson, chairman of thenew group. More than 1,000 citizens, including some of the most outstandingin the theater, radio, and motion pictures, fine arts, dance, publishing, literature,educational and allied fields have already joined the division which will activelycampaign for the reelection of Davis.And then further in the article appears the statement of those whowere connected with the formation of that group, in which this language is used, "also Howard De Silva"; and then naming numerousothers. And finally in the list the name of Will Geer appearsMr. GEER. Among a thousand.
Mr. TAVENNER (continuing). As a signer.Did you participate in the formation of that organization?
Mr. GEER. I claim the privilege.
Mr. TAVENNER. What privilege?
Mr. GEER. On the grounds of incrimination. Fifth Amendment.Incrimination, fifth amendment.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you entertain at any meetings of the Communist Party or branches of the Communist Party other than the mattersI have already referred to?
Mr. GEER. Ancient history. I stand on the grounds of the fifthamendment.
Mr. TAVENNER. On the grounds of the fifth amendment or ancienthistory ?
Mr. GEER. Well, on the amendment.
Mr. TAVENNER. To answer the question might tend to incriminateyou ? Is that what you mean ?
Mr. GEER. Correct, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Since so much emphasis has been placed by youon the question of ancient history, are you a member of the Communist Party now
Mr. GEER. I refuse to answer on the same grounds.
Mr. TAVENNER. Ancient history?
Mr. GEER. No; same grounds.
Mr. WooD. Mr. Geer, we can get along a lot faster if you will makeyour answers responsive to the questions that are asked you.
Mr. GEER. I will try to, sir.
Mr. WooD. It will help the committee a lot and save a lot of time.
Mr. GEER. I will do my best.182COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Geer, I have before me an April 27, 1948, issueof the Daily Worker, in which under the column "Broadway Beat"there is an article relating to you entitled "Actor's Reply to Columnist" I will read the first paragraph and then go down into the bodyabout a matter which I want to ask you about.Will Geer sounds off in a letter to the editor of a theater publication.We see that a certain columnist has attempted to slough off unemployment inour theater by attacking what he calls the censorship of the artist in the SovietUnion. He tblls a discouraged actor to beware of casting envious glances at thegood employment of the Soviet actor because some Soviet composers have justbeen criticized by the Soviet state.Then in the body of the article appears this statement attributedto you:The clucking that has gone on about control of the Soviet composer has beenlargely hearsay. He is unaware apparently of the Soviet cultural program. Asan American who has worked in the Soviet theater and cinema, I am all forgovernment participation in show business. Over a period of 25 years the Soviettheater has given infinitely more variety than has been evidenced in the Londonor New York stages. It has given year-round work for the artist, vacationswith pay, free day's salaries to young students of the theater. Whenever I writeto the young would-be artists of the theater that have given up probably or havebeen unable to afford study, I am reminded of the young actor I talked to inMoscow before the war. He was to enroll as a student at the Trade UnionTheater, a theater of repertory that was largely supported by trade-unionistsof a ball bearing factory. I asked him-if he was just starting out. "Oh, no.I have spent one season already in the Realistic Theater and one in the MolleTheater"-and so forth. Were you correctly quoted in that article ?
Mr. GEER. I stand on the grounds of the fifth amendment.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did that article correctly reflect your views aboutgovernment participation in the show businessMr. GEER. Thanks for reading it, but I stand on the grounds of thefifth amendment.
Mr. TAVENNER (continuing). At the time it was alleged to have beenmade by you ?
Mr. GEER. I stand on the same privilege.
Mr. TAVENNER. That you refuse to answer ?
Mr. WooD. The reporter can't get your indication.
Mr. GEER. I am sorry.
Mr. TAVENNER. When were you in Russia
Mr. GEER. I went on a theatrical tour to see the Moscow Art Festivalin 1935.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was that the first time that you had been toMoscow ?
Mr. GEER. It was.
Mr. TAVENNER. The first time you had been in the Soviet Union?
Mr. GEER. It was, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Is it the only time you have been there ?
Mr. GEER. Yes, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was the purpose of your trip ?
Mr. GEER. To see the theaters.Our theater was in a pretty badstate at this time. It was a repertory theater.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you go alone ?
Mr. GEER. I went alone.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you go in a representative capacity of anycharacter ?COMMUNISM INMOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY183
Mr. GEER. No; just the theater festival tour.
Mr. TAVENNER. And did you pay all of your own expenses, or werepart of your expenses contributed ?
Mr. GEER. Paid my own expenses.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was Harold Ware in Russia at that time?
Mr. GEER. Not that I know of, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was Harold Ware your brother-in-law ?
Mr. GEER. No, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you related in any manner to him ?
Mr. GEER. No, sir; not related.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was your wife's name ?
Mr. GEER. Herta Ware.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was she related to Harold Ware ?
Mr. GEER. I imagine she was. He has been dead for a' number ofyears.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was her relationship ?
Mr. GEER. I hadn't met the lady at that time.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, the relationship would be just the same,wouldn't it, then?
Mr. GEER. It would be an in-law relationship. I don't call an in-lawa relative.
Mr. TAVENNER. I asked you whether he was your brother-in-law.-Mr. GEER. Brother-in-law?
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes.
Mr. GEER. No; he is not my brother-in-law.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was the relationship of Harold Ware to yourwife?
Mr. GEER. I would call him an uncle-in-law.
Mr. TAVENNER. An uncle-in-law?
Mr. GEER. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was the relationship of your wife to MotherBloor?
Mr. GEER. My wife is the granddaughter of an 88-year-old ladyknown as Mother Bloor to many people who have no truck withcommunism.
Mr. TAVENNER. And did Harold Ware have any connection of anykind with your trip to Russia.
Mr. GEER. I have never met Harold Ware.I hadn't met my wifeat the time either. I had not met my wife.(Representative Francis E. Walter left the hearing room at thispoint.)
Mr. TAVENNER. I hand you a photostatic copy of a passport application which was obtained by the State Department by subpena ducestecum of a person by the name of Thomas Gilbert, where you appearor the name Will Geer appears as the identifying witness. Will youexamine it, please ?
Mr. GEER (after examining document). What was the question youwanted to ask of me, sir?
Mr. TAVENNER. I don't recall how the question was worded, but Iwill now ask you whether or not you were a witness to that application.
Mr. GEER. I recognize the picture. I don't remember the name, butI certainly signed the application.
Mr. TAVENNER. And it is your signature?184COMMUNISM
Mr. GEER. Yes.IN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRYPeople frequently ask for favors of that sort,recommendations.
Mr. TAVENNER. The man's name appears as Thomas Gilbert in theapplication. You say you recognize the photograph?
Mr. GEER. I recognize the photograph but not the name.
Mr. TAVENNER. YOU do not know him by the name of ThomasGilbert ?
Mr. GEER. I do not.
Mr. TAVENNER. Whose photograph is that if that is not ThomasGilbert?
Mr. GEER. I wouldn't remember the-oh, well, I might. It hasbeen a number of years ago. What date was that? I might haveremembered the name, but we meet so many people that it is im-possible for me to connect the name with the picture.
Mr. TAVENNER. You have just told us that you did not rememberhim by that name. I want to know by what name you did knowthe individual whose picture appears there.
Mr. GEER. I just don't recognize that name.
Mr. TAVENNER. But who is the man ?
Mr. GEER. I don't know.
Mr. TAVENNER. You know the man ?
Mr. GEER. I know the man's face, but I do not know his name.
Mr. TAVENNER. Never heard the name Whitey Roland ?
Mr. GEER. I never heard that name.'Mr. TAVENNER. Never heard the name Whitey Roland ?
Mr. GEER. Never heard the name-1937 is the date ?
Mr. TAVENNER. You stated in your affidavit that you had knownthis individual, Thomas Gilbert, for a period of 4 years.
Mr. GEER. At that time.That's 1937.At that time I probablydid.
Mr. TAVENNER. I desire to introduce this photostatic copy into evidence and request that it be marked "Geer Exhibit No. 2."(The document referred to above was marked "Geer ExhibitNo. 2.")
Mr. TAVENNER. I hand you another application for passport, pur-porting to be under the name of Thomas Gilbert, a photographattached, in which Isabel S. C. Wright appears as the identifyingwitness. Will you examine that application and look at the photograph of Thomas Gilbert?
Mr. GEER. I have never seen that man before.
Mr. TAVENNER. It is an entirely different photograph from theone in the application which you signed as a witness, is it not ?
Mr. GEER. I would say so, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you know the person whose photograph ap-pears on the application?
Mr. GEER. I have never seenMr. TAVENNER. On the application just handed you ?
Mr. GEER. I have never seen this face before to my knowledge.Ihave never seen his face before.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you ever confer with the party whose photo-graph appears in exhibit No. 2, which was the first copy I handedyou' Retained in committee files.COMMUNISM INMOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY185
Mr. GEER. To my knowledge----
Mr. TAVENNER. Just a moment. About his acting as a witnessto an application for passport by you ?
Mr. GEER. As far as I can recollect, never, to the best of my mem-ory. I don't believe I really understood that, Mr. Tavenner.
Mr. TAVENNER. To simplify the question, did you ever talk to theperson whose photograph appears on the exhibit 2 and ask him to actas the identifying witness in an application to be filed by you ?
Mr. GEER. To the best of my knowledge, I have never seen the man.
Mr. TAVENNER. Let me hand you again exhibit No. 2, which contains the photograph of the individual whose photograph yourecognize.
Mr. GEER. This is No. 1Is this exhibit No. 1?
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, it's exhibit No. 2, but it is the first of the photostats which I handed you.
Mr. GEER. You've got me all mixed up on 2's and 1's. I'm sorry.
Mr. TAVENNER. That's easily understandable. So I am handingyou now the application which is marked "Geer Exhibit No. 2" andcontains the photograph of the person known the application, asThomas Gilbert, and I ask you whether you at any time made an arrangement with the individual whose photograph appears there bywhich he was to act as the identifying witness for you if you acted asthe identifying witness for him.(At this point Representative Charles E. Potter left the hearing andRepresentative Clyde Doyle entered the hearing.)
Mr. GEER. I believe, to the best of my recollection, sir, when I applied for a passport in 1935 my witness was a woman and had nothingto do with this person at all.
Mr. TAVENNER. I know, but will you answer my question as towhether or not you ever had conversation with the individual whosephotograph appears there of the character that I mentioned to you ?
Mr. GEER. To the best of my recollection, never.
Mr. TAVENNER. How many passports have you obtained ?
Mr. GEER. In 1935, the year I went to the festival, and in 1920 I wentover in a cattle boat, one of Harold Swift's cattle boats, after I gotout of school, but I don't think I had to have a passport then as Iremember. Maybe I did. That's about 1920. It's when I was justa kid. I remember I worked over on a cattle boat. And I have forgotten if we had to have passports or not.
Mr. TAVENNER. What were the circumstances under which yousigned this application which is exhibit No. 2 as an identifying witfiess ?
Mr. GEER. It's entirely vague in my mind. Someone just asked methey wanted to get a passport. People frequently come byMr. TAVENNER. Had you known the individual for 4 years?
Mr. GEER. Yes. I think he was something to do with the merchantmarine or something or other.
Mr. WOOD. Counsel, we are going to have to suspend here for about20 minutes so the members may answer this call, and we will resumeat 11: 30.(Thereupon, at 11:10 a. m,, a recess was taken until 11:45 a. m.,at which time the following proceedings were had:)

Mr. TAVENNER. Yes, sir.
Mr. Geer, do you know the purpose for which Thomas Gilbertsought permission to travel abroad?
Mr. GEER. To the best of my recollection, no. Just he wanted togo. He's a merchant seaman. I think I should add, if you wouldpermit me, that I worked as a merchant seaman in between jobson shore and naturally I met a great many seamen at that time,and there would be dozens and dozens-hundreds of people, in factthat I couldn't recall the name of and still at the same time I'd beperfectly willing to help them out on getting a reference for a jobor anything of that sort.(At this point, Representative Harold H. Velde entered the hearin)GEER.Gr.(continuing).At the same time, you wouldn't remembertheir name but you'd know their face.
Mr. TAVENNER. You don't mean that you would sign an identi-fying affidavit that you had known a person for 4 years if you hadn'tknown him, would you ?
Mr. GEER. I certainly wouldn't.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, can you state whether or not the person whosephotograph appears on exhibit No. 2. which I will hand to you again,is a person who was known to you by the name of Roland?
Mr. GEER. No, I have no recollection about the name whatever.The face does look familiar. Just as the face of a lady in the backcourt there I hadn't seen for 20 years.
Mr. TAVENNER. I desire to offer in evidence the second passportapplication and ask that it be marked "Exhibit Geer 3."
Mr. WooD. It will be admitted.I thought it was admitted al-ready.(The document referred to was marked "Exhibit Geer 3.") 1
Mr. TAVENNER. And also the other excerpts from the papers whichI read in evidence, namely, the issue of the Daily Worker of October20, 1936, [p. 4], which I ask be marked "Exhibit Geer 4," and of theDaily Worker of April 27, 1948, [p. 16], which I asked be marked"Exhibit Geer 5."
Mr. WooD. They may be marked.(The documents referred to were marked "Exhibits Geer 4 andGeer 5," respectively.) 2
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Geer, were you a member of or affiliated inany way with the American Peace Mobilization?
Mr. GEER. Well, there are about four or five hundred organiza-tions listed as being here, and I'd have to really consult this book tofind out.
Mr. TAVENNER. TO find out whether you were a member ?
Mr. GEER. No. To find out whether it's-what it's listed.are several hundred organizations.1ThereIt is difficult to remember theRetained in committee files.a See appendix following conclusion of hearings printed under this title.COMMUNISM INMOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY187names of them, as it is difficult to remember the names of people. SoI ask the privilege of looking at this book to find out whether that isone so listed.
Mr. TAVENNER. What difference does it make, in answer to the question of whether or not you were a member, as to whether it's listed ina book ?
Mr. GEER. I simply list all things like this as an-emotional wordsused in a time that is altogether-it is like
Mr. TAVENNER. That doesn't change the fact of your membershipor nonmembership, does it?
Mr. GEER. No. I just simply stand on the grounds of the amendment.'Mr. TAVENNER. In other words, you refuse to answer on the groundsthat to do soMr. GEER. Might incriminate me.
Mr. TAVENNER (continuing). Might tend to incriminate you?
Mr. GEER. Those things are years ago.
Mr. KEARNEY. That is again a period of ancient history, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. GEER. Yes. At the present time, hospital benefits. I play vet-erans' hospitals. A little group goes around and plays veterans' hospitals. For all I know they might be listed in another 6 months assomething altogether out of order. Things change very rapidly nowadays.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you at any time a sponsor of the Cultural andScientific Conference for World Peace?
Mr. GEER. The name doesn't sound familiar, but I'd like-I reallydon't recall the name of that one, sir. I am sorry.
Mr. TAVENNER. All right. It was held on March 25, 26, and 27 of1949 in New York City under the sponsorship of the National Council of the Arts, Sciences, and Professions.
Mr. WooD. What is your answer?
Mr. GEER. The name sounds unfamiliar to me, but I would standon the grounds of the same privilege.
Mr. WOOD. You mean you decline to answer the question?
Mr. GEER. On the ground of the same privilege, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Have you at any time been a member of or affili-ated with the International Workers Order ?

Mr. TAVENNER. Were you at any time affiliated with the WorkersAlliance of Greater New York either as a sponsor of any of its programs or policies or activities ?

Mr. WOOD. Well, now, which?
Mr. GEER. May I link them together, sir? I'd appreciate it.
Mr. TAVENNER. You are a member of the Screen Actors' Guild?
Mr. GEER. I am, sir. I pay dues. I am a life member of the Actors'Equity Association and AFRA, radio organization. Those are theonly organizations I can think of I paid dues to in my life.
Mr. TAVENNER. Have you ever paid dues to the Communist Party ?
Mr. GEER. Decline on the grounds it might tend to incriminate me.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you ever questioned by officials of the mov-ing-picture industry regarding your alleged activity in Communistfront organizations-that is, organizations which have been cited asCommunist fronts by the Attorney General of the United States andthis committee or other committees ?
Mr. GEER. NO.They simply told me they didn't believe every-thing they read.
Mr. TAVENNER. Then, they discussed the matter with you prior toyour employment?
Mr. GEER. Just casually. People around the studio. I wouldn'tremember the names.
Mr. TAVENNER. Who was it said to you they didn't believe every-thing they read or heard ?
Mr. GEER. That's an old saying of mine too. I don't know whichone./
Mr. TAVENNER. You quoted some official of the moving-picture in-dustry as having made that statement.
Mr. GEER. I wouldn't recall who it was, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, whom did you talk to on the subject of Com-munist-front organizations within the industry ?
Mr. GEER. I can't remember. There are many people that discussthe subject, but they would probably be in the hundreds. I couldn'tpossibly remember their names.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you discuss it with them at the time of youremployment on any of the projects that you undertook?
Mr. GEER. TO my recollection, no, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you employed by any of the people withwhom you had discussed that subject?
Mr. GEER. I imagine so.
Mr. TAVENNER. Who were they?
Mr. GEER. I wouldn't recollect offhand, sir, but I would presumeso because I have done 15 pictures with 4 major studios.
Mr. TAVENNER. And did any of those producers talk to you aboutyour activities either within-alleged activities within the CommunistParty or in Communist-front organizations? That is, organizationscited as being Communist-front organizations?
Mr. GEER. I discussed it with one director perhaps, and he askedme just what I was anyway, and I told him I was a conservationist.
Mr. TAVENNER. Conservationist?COMMUNISM IN' MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY189
Mr. GEER. Conservationist, sir. That is my philosophy. I believein returning the land to the same shape we found it in. I believe alsoin conserving the things that one-world Wendell Willkie talked aboutand F. D. R. got for us. That's my philosophy.
Mr. TAVENNER. Now, did he ask you about communism
Mr. GEER. No, not to my recollection. He asked me what I wasanyway. That was my answer.
Mr. KEARNEY. Who was that director? What was his name?
Mr. GEER. I can't recollect the name of it, the particular occasion,but I do remember making that statement, because the man happenedto be opposed to F. D. R., and he didn't think much of it, whoever itwas.
Mr. TAVENNER. But you did not tell him that you had been connected with Communist-front organizations ?
Mr. GEER. I stand on the grounds of the fifth amendment in answering that question, sir, because I already said that that's a hysterical word.
Mr. TAVENNER. I do not see how it could tend to incriminate youto state whether or not you discussed the subject with an employer,or an employer with you.
Mr. GEER. Well, I'm-I really-that's just something casual thathappens in everyday life. I have really-that's all the conversation Ihappen to recall on it. I say that would happen, oh, an average ofonce a day during the past few years, discussions with people aboutphilosophy.
Mr. TAVENNER. I'm speaking of your employers. Did your employers discuss your activities with you daily ?
Mr. GEER. Never in connection with employment to the best of myknowledge. I would be quite willing to discuss it with them any time.
Mr. TAVENNER. More willing than you have been with this committee ?
Mr. GEER. I should say so, sir, because this is a peculiar atmospherewe are living in today. And the citizen has to see clearly all the timehow important it is to preserve individual rights.
Mr. TAVENNER. You would answer then questions propounded toyou by your employer as to whether or not you had been or are atthe present a member of the Communist Party ?
Mr. GEER. I should think I would, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. I have no further questions.
Mr. GEER. Thank you very much.
Mr. WooD. Mr. Doyle?
Mr. DOYLE. NO questions.
Mr. WOOD. Mr. Velde?
Mr. VELDE. Do you consider yourself to be a patriotic citizen ?
Mr. GEER. I do indeed, sir. I love America. I love it enough to wantto make it better.
Mr. VELDE. In the event of an armed conflict in which the UnitedStates would find itself opposed to Soviet Russia, would you be willingto fight on the side of the United States ?
Mr. GEER. Factually, I would grow vegetables for victory for theFarm Bureau as I did before and play hospitals. It would be a wonderful idea, in fact, if they put every man my age in the front linesand in Washington fellows on the other side. I think wars would benegotiated immediately. I approve of that.190COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY
Mr. VELDE. You say you would be willing to join the Army?
Mr. GEER. Indeed I would, sir, if they could take me.
Mr. VELDE. That's all.
Mr. GEER. My function is growing vegetables and entertaining,however.
Mr. KEARNEY. Mr. Geer, there is one thought running through mymind on your various answers here, and I wish you would explain tome because I just can't get your reasoning. Will you tell this committee as to membership in these various organizations that have beenasked you by counsel, and that you have declined to answer on theground it might incriminate you: How would such an answer in-criminate you?
Mr. GEER. Well, in my opinion it is something set up outside. It isthe committee set-up. And you yourself or this committee has madethese stipulations. It is something that has been set up and to mymind created artificially.
Mr. KE.ARNY. You mean to say that this committee has set up thefact that if you said that you belonged to any one of these particularorganizations asked by the counsel that we would have you in the position where you have incriminated yourself ?
Mr. GEER. I don't quite undertsand that, but so far as this commit-tee is concerned I believe so, sir. That's my feeling today in 1951.
Mr. KEARNEY. In other words, you think that this committee is apersecuting committee?
Mr. GEER. To my mind there's great similarities between the Inquisition and people like in our country that have been persecuted, likeMormons.
Mr. KEARNEY. IS that your's or your counsel's?
Mr. GEER. That's my own opinion.
Mr. KEARNEY. I see counsel advising you on your answers there.
Mr. MARGOLIS (attorney for the witness). I will be glad to give youmy opinion, Mr. Kearney.
Mr. KEARNEY. You're not testifying.
Mr. MARGOLIS. NO, but I'd be gladMr. GEER. I'd be glad to answer that question.
Mr. KEARNEY. Do you believe, Mr. Geer, that the Congress of theUnited States has the right, to set up a committee such as this is tosearch out subversive activities in this country ?
Mr. GEER. I'm an entertainer and not a lawyer. I wouldn't knowwhether it would be right or not.
Mr. KEARNEY. Well, you seem to have enough answers on all othersubjects here, questions.Can't you answer that question "Yes" or"No"?
Mr. GEER. As an entertainer simply and not a lawyer, I reallycouldn't answer that question, sir. In my opinion, I think it wouldbe more important right now to investigate inflation and the highcost of living. That's my own opinion.
Mr. KEARNEY. Well, I think you've got something there too.
Mr. GEER. We all of us have to appear in a turkey once in a while.I don't think the public is seriously interested in the factMr. KEARNEY. That's all, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. WooD. Mr. Jackson?
Mr. JACKSON. Mr. Geer, you say you appeared in a picture calledThe Tall Target in February or March ?COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY191
Mr. GEER. February or March of this year, sir.
Mr. JACKSON. I should preface this for the record that the introduction of names I shall mention has no particular connotation. Whowas the producer of Tall Target?
Mr. GEER. The producer of the picture was I believe Mr. RichardGoldstone.
Mr. JACKSON. Who did the script ?
Mr. GEER. I wouldn't know about that, sir. I met a man namedon the set-but I couldn't recollect his name.
Mr. JACKSON. Who was the director of the picture ?
Mr. GEER. The director of the picture was Anthony Mann.
Mr. JACKSON. And on Lights Out who was the producer ?
Mr. GEER. The producer on that picture was a man named Buckner,a very brilliant producer, and the director was an exceptionally remarkable director named Marc Robeson, who has had several successes.
Mr. JACKSON. Who did the script on Lights Out ?
Mr. GEER. I imagine the producer did. He usually does his.
Mr. JACKSON. On The Barefoot Mailman, who was the producer?
Mr. GEER. The producer on that, Mr. Cohn I think. He's the sonin-law of Harry Cohn. I believe that's the name. Robert Cohn.
Mr. JACKSON. Do you know who wrote the script on that ?
Mr. GEER. NO. It was a western laid in Florida. That's about allI recollect about it.
Mr. JACKSON. And the director?
Mr. GEER. The director of that was quite a brilliant young directornamed Earl McAvoy from Boston.
Mr. JACKSON. What is your agency, Mr. Geer ?
Mr. GEER. My agency is Paul Wilkins, 9006 Sunset Boulevard.
Mr. JACKSON. On the "strip," is it ?
Mr. GEER. Yes. On the "strip," sir.
Mr. JACKSON. I stress again that the names given by the witnessin answer to my questions are not necessarily connected with the subject of the committee's investigation.That's all, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. GEER. Thank you very much.
Mr. WooD. Mr. Geer, did I understand you to say in response tocounsel's question a while ago concerning the conversations that youhad had with the employers that some one of them had told you thathe didn't believe all he read about your connection withMr. GEER. Yes. And I added I don't believe all I hear either.
Mr. WooD. Well, in connection with the organizations about whichyou have been interrogated by counsel, particularly concerning youraffiliation or membership with them, don't you think that it would beenlightening to the party, whoever it was in connection with youremployment that made that expression that he didn't believe all heread in the paper, to set him completely right about it now by answering the questions frankly here ?
Mr. GEER. I think there is too decided an atmosphere of fear nowadays and hysteria to answer that, sir.
Mr. WOOD. Don't you feel now that your declination to answer questions here leaves you in the position of either giving false testimonyor of tacitly admitting your membership therein?192COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY
Mr. GEER. I don't feel so, sir.
Mr. WOOD. You don't?
Mr. GEER. No; I don't really.
Mr. WOOD. If you're not a member of such organizations, to say sowouldn't incriminate you, would it?
Mr. GEER. I'd appreciate it so much, Mr. Wood, if you'd ask mequestions about the thousands of other benefits I played.
Mr. WooD. I'm asking you about the questions I'm concerned aboutand that this committee is concerned about.
Mr. GEER. That's whyMr. Woon. And I would very much appreciate a frank answer. Iask you the question: If you are not a member of a single one of theseorganizations about which you have been interrogated, do you admitthat it wouldn't incriminate you to say you are not a member of them ?Don't you admit that?
Mr. GEER. Mr. WoodMr. WOOD. I'd like an answer to that question if I may.
Mr. GEER. I frankly don't know how to answer that question.
Mr. WooD. You don't know how to answer it?
Mr. GEER. I don't know how in this day, 1951.
Mr. WOOD. I will try to make it a little more explicit. You areasked particularly about membership-well, in the Communist Party.Now, if you are not a member of the Communist Party and havenever been, do you think it would incriminate you to say so?
Mr. GEER. At this particular time, although the Communist Partyis a perfectly legal one, I think they shouldMr. WooD. I'm asking if you're not a member would it incriminateyou to say you're not a member ?
Mr. GEER. I'm standing on the Constitution. I believe that they'rebeing persecuted now like the Mormons, the Jews, the Quakers, theMasonsMr. WOOD. That isn't responsive.
Mr. GEER (continuing). Even radical Republicans in Lincoln's day.
Mr. WOOD. That's not responsive to my question.
Mr. GEER. I'm trying to answer directly, sir.
Mr. WooD. I want to know what your conception is about whatincriminates you to tell the truth before this committee, if it is thetruth, that you are not a member of the Communist Party. Thatwouldn't in any sense incriminate you, would it?
Mr. GEER. I really believe, sir, that the best answer to that, thatI'm just allergic to meetings and things of that sort, and I stand onthe advice of my counsel thatMr. WooD. And decline to answer that question ?
Mr. GEER. In this particular day, April 11, 1951, I do, sir, withthe situation of the world as it is. It's a hysterical situation.
Mr. WOOD. That's all.SMr. GEER. Thank you, sir.
Mr. VELDE. I have one more question. Did I understand you tosay that you felt the Communist Party was a legal party ?
Mr. GEER. I understand so. I believe that.
Mr. VELDE. You understand it is ?
Mr. GEER. To my understanding.COMMUNISM IN
Mr. VELDE.193MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRYWould it be any crime to admit your membership ina legal party, then?
Mr. GEER. In this day of hysteria it is, sir.
Mr. VELDE. That's all.
Mr. GEER. Because they're like-Mr. WooD. Then you want to leave it before this committee thenthat in your opinion it would subject you to the danger of selfincrimination to either admit it or deny it ?
Mr. GEER. I think so, sir.
Mr. WooD. Even if your denial was true?If you should deny itand it should be true, that would still incriminate you ? Is that theway you want to leave it ?
Mr. GEER. Well, I'm just simply an entertainer, and I'm not alawyer, sir, and I can't testify.
Mr. WooD. Is that all the answer you desire to give the committee?
Mr. GEER. That is sir. We don't get the training in law that youdo down in Athens, Ga.
Mr. WooD. You have a couple of very astute counsels.You canconfer with them.
Mr. GEER. I trust lawyers even when they back shows I'm in. Ihave had some bad experiences in one called Tobacco Road.
Mr. WooD. I didn't ask your opinion about lawyers.I'm just com-menting on the fact you have one on each side of you.
Mr. GEER. I trust the lawyers, sir.
Mr. WooD. Did the lawyers advise you to say that it would tendto incriminate you to deny your membership in an organization towhich you have never belonged ?
Mr. GEER. Well, I take a lawyer's backing if he backed a play, butin this situationMr. WooD. I asked if they advised youMr. GEER. Mr. WoodMr. WOOD. You said you answered on the advice of counsel.Iwant to know if the counsel have advised you that that is a correctanswer and bona fide, straightforwardMr. GEER. I think we're getting out of bounds, Mr. Wood, aboutthe lawyers and things. I'm .just simply an entertainer and like toentertain for the public.
Mr. WOOD. Then do you want to decline to answer that question asto whether or not the attorneys advised you ?
Mr. GEER. I think it would be advisable, sir. I'm sorry.
Mr. WOOD. All right, if you want to leave that cloud on them.
Mr. GEER. Oh, there are lots of clouds, war clouds, all sorts ofclouds.
Mr. WOOD. That's all.
Mr. GEER. Thank you, Mr. Wood and committee.(Witness excused.)
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Robert Lees.
Mr. WooD. Mr. Lees, do you solemnly swear that the evidence yougive this committee shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothingbut the truth, so help you God?
Mr. LEEs. I do.
Mr. WOOD. For the purpose of this investigation, Mr. Reporter, letthe record disclose that there is a quorum of the full committee present-Mr. Jackson, Mr. Velde, Mr. Kearney, Mr. Doyle, and Mr. Wood.194COMMUNISM INMOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRYTESTIMONY OF ROBERT LEES, ACCOMPANIED BY HIS COUNSEL,ROBERT W. KENNY AND BEN MARGOLIS
Mr. TAVENNER. What is your full name, please, sir?
Mr. LEES. Robert Lees.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you represented here by counsel?
Mr. LEES. Yes; I am.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will counsel please identify themselves for therecord ?
Mr. KENNY. Robert W. Kenny, Los Angeles.
Mr. MARGOLIS. Ben Margolis, Los Angeles.
Mr. LEES. I happen to have a statement here I would like to intro-duce at this time if I may.
Mr. WOOD. When counsel has finished his examination, we will beglad for you to file any statement with the clerk for the record.
Mr. LEES. Thank you.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Lees, will you state when and where you wereborn, please, sir ?
Mr. LEES. I was born in San Francisco, July 10, 1912.
Mr. TAVENNER. What is your present place of residence?
Mr. LEES. Los Angeles. 742 Schumacher Drive, Los Angeles 48.
Mr. TAVENNER. What is your present occupation ?
Mr. LEES. I am a screen writer.
Mr. TAVENNER. How. long have you lived in California ?
Mr. LEES. All my life.
Mr. TAVENNER. Have you been engaged in the practice of your pro-fession elsewhere or solely in California ?
Mr. LEES. Only once, sir, I believe I would say was outside of Cali-fornia, when I came to Washington to write a film for General Sommervell called Substitution and Conversion during the war. It wasa film that was necessary for conservation of critical materials atthe time.
Mr. TAVENNER. What has been your educational background andtraining ?
Mr. LEES. I was in grammar school in San Francisco, Lowell HighSchool, San Francisco. I came to Los Angeles and started atU. C. L. A., and unfortunately there was a depression on at the timeand I couldn't finish my freshman year, and that's the conclusion ofmy education formally.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you give the committee a brief account ofyour employment record?
Mr. LEES. I started writing--well, let me put it this way: I startedacting in an extra capacity, bit capacity, for the years 1930 to 1934.Starting in 1934 1 became a writer at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, where Idid some 55, roughly, short films-Robert Benchley, Pete Smith, CrimeDoesn't Pay. Quite a few shorts, two of which won Academy Awardsat the time.Then I started writing features. And they were primarily comedies. There was one, No Time for Love, with Fred MacMurray,Claudette Colbert.
Mr. TAVENNER. When was that?
Mr. LEES. It's going to be very difficult for me to get exact dateson these things. I think that roughly was about 1942 I believe, 1941,COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY195something like that. I can't really recall exactly the dates of thesefilms.But then I worked at Universal-International and did quite a fewfilms for them, mostly Abbott and Costello comedies; I think aboutlive or six of them. Hold That Ghost, Meet Frankenstein, the present one, Meet the Invisible Man, Widow of Wagon's Gap. I can'trecall them. Must have been five or six of those.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was the last production that you worked on?
Mr. LEES. The last production released ?
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes.
Mr. LEES. Or the last employment?
Mr. TAVENNER. Let us say the last employment.
Mr. LEES. The last employment I had was at Republic Studioswhere I was employed to write a picture for Judy Canova.
Mr. TAVENNER. When was that.
Mr. LEES. I don't quite know, but it was about-I would thinkabout a week or two before I received my subpena, and I rememberattributing the fact that I was suddenly let go to the fact that maybemy apearance before this committee was responsible.
Mr. WooD. You were just asked when it was.
Mr. LiES. Well, I couldn't understand why I was not working inthe middle of the assignment was all. I wanted to explain the reason,
Mr. Wood, as I understand it.
Mr. WooD. Well, now, will you now answer the question when itwas?
Mr. LEES. I say about 3 or 4 weeks before-oh-I received my sub-pena. It was the beginning of this year sometime.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was your last employment prior to that ?
Mr. LEES. My last employment prior to that, at Universal-Inter-national Studios where I was working on a picture for Jimmy Duranteand Donald O'Connor.
Mr. TAVENNER. And what was the last production that you workedon?
Mr. LEES. The last production was The Real McCoy for Abbott andCostello, which hasn't been released, and the one before that whichis now playing the theaters is Meet the Invisible Man.
Mr. TAVENNER. And what was the. date of your work on thoseproductions ?
Mr. LEES. It's going to be very difficult.
Mr. TAVENNER. I mean the date of your employment let us say.
Mr. LEES. Well, it's hard for me to say this, for the simple reasonthat some of these pictures have been written I would say maybe ayear before they were released. The latter part of 1950 1 was workingon the Jimmy Durante-Donald O'Connor film. The Abbott andCostello film I guess was at the beginning of that year approximately,1950.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you tell the committee the circumstancesand the details of your employment for those two pictures, The RealMcCoy and-what was the name of the other one?
Mr. LEES. Meet the Invisible Man.The circumstances I- believeare similar to the circumstances of any writer in Hollywood who'semployed. You're called up by your agent and told to go out to the81595-51-pt. 1--10196COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRYstudio, that you have a job. If you're not called by your agent, you'renot working.
Mr. TAVENNER. Who was your agent?
Mr. LEES. My agent is the Sam Jaffe Agency. It's on SunsetBoulevard. I don't know the exact address.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you confer with your employer before accept-ing the employment, or was that done entirely through your agent?
Mr. LEES. No; sometimes there would be a discussion as to the storyand whether or not we felt like-whether I felt the story could bedone or not.
Mr. TAVENNER. That was prior to your employment?
Mr. LEES. Sometimes. Usually you would have the script to examine to see whether you felt suitable as a writer or that you liked thestory or that you thought you could do the job. If you felt that youcould and the studio wanted to hire you, you said that you could andyou were hired.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you represented by any other agency otherthan the one you have mentioned ?
Mr. LEES. I was represented by two other agencies in the time thatI have been working in films. I was represented for a great numberof years by the Paul Kohner Agency. I was represented a shorttime
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you state the.name again, please?
Mr. LEES. Paul Kohner, K-o-h-n-e-r. The Paul Kohner Agency.And for a short time with the Nat Goldstone Agency.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was a person by the name of George Wilmer yourpersonal agent in connectionMr. LEES. He was the agent in charge of writers for Nat Goldstone,and on that basis he represented me along with others in the agencywho were assistants in the literary department.
Mr. TAVENNER. Has that representation continued on to the presenttime ?
Mr. LEES. That representation was terminated. I don't know exactly what day it was or what date it was, but I believe I have beenwith the Jaffe Agency for over 2 years or something like that. Twoyears I believe.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was the reason for the termination of yourrelationship?
Mr. LEES. I felt, as when I left Mr. Kohner, that I was not getting the story sales and the jobs at the time. Whether it was theagent's fault or whether it was the fact the industry was in a slumpbecause of the world situation some 2 years back-it's picked up since.I left anyhow and have been working with the Sam Jaffe Agency.I have been represented, rather, by the Sam Jaffe Agency.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did others leave that agency at the same time thatyou did ?
Mr. LEES. I don't know who left or who didn't leave, but there hasbeen a great number of circulations among agents and their clients.You stay with an agency for a while, and if you don't like the jobsyou're getting or if you don't think you're getting jobs, you change.You change for reasons that maybe a new agency would want to makean impression with you and get you a job because you're fresh,and you might feel like you're an old "has been" if you have beenCOMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY197with an agency too long. There's a constant movement around. Someare satisfied for a while with their agents, but I have known writersto leave one agency and go to two or three others and come back tothe original one.
Mr. TAVENNER. You spoke of the practice of conferring with officials of your various employers about the storyMr. LEES. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER (continuing).Prior to your employment-
Mr. LEES. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. (continuing). Which is a reasonable and naturalthing.
Mr. LEES. That's right.
Mr. TAVENNER. Who are some of those with whom you have conferred ?
Mr. LEES. Robert Arthur has been the producer of quite a few ofthe Abbott and Costello's I have worked on.
Mr. TAVENNER. Of what movie company ?
Mr. LEES. At Universal-International.
Mr. TAVENNER. All right. Will you name others?
Mr. LEES. Let me see. Sidney Pickert was the producer at Republicon our last picture-my last picture. I can't-I worked for JackChertok originally in Metro-Goldwyn-Mlayer shorts department.
Mr. TAVENNER.Will you spell that, please?
Mr. LEES. C-h-e-r-t-o-k, I believe, is the spelling. Let's see. Mymind has suddenly gone blank. I can't recall any other producers,but I know there are quite a few. I'm trying to think of them.
Mr. TAVENNER. I'm not asking for the names of producers generally.I'm asking for those with whom you had discussions of your scriptand the story.
Mr. LEES. Oh, that's very hard to say in the sense that I don't knowwhat you'd call discussions. Sometimes there would be no discussion.The script would be taken to me by the agent. I'd say I would want togo to work on this. And, if the studio had already made up its mindthat I was the man to write the film, the job was done and the discussions took place after I was hired. There have been many interviewsI have gone on in which no one has been hired because of a feeling ofmutual dissatisfaction perhaps with story and concepts.
Mr. TAVENNER. Have there been any instances in which there wasrefusal for other reasons?
Mr. LEES. I don't know what you mean by "other reasons."
Mr. TAVENNER. Reasons other than story concept.
Mr. LEES. Not particularly that I know of. There might have beenreasons of maybe. a personality problem, but that's whether the producer felt he could get along with you. That might be a reason.
Mr. TAVENNER. In any of the instances in which you were not employed, were you questioned about your affiliations with the Communist Party or any Communist-front organizations? That is, organizations which had been cited by the Attorney General of the UnitedStates or this committee or other organizations, Government organizations ?
Mr. LEES. Was I questioned?
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes.
Mr. LEES. One moment, please.198COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRYI wanted to be sure about my legal ground on this. The reasonthere has been no question of political affiliations in terms of my employment that I have discussed or have been asked to discuss by anyof the people I have worked for. Even up to the very last time I washired, the general concept seemed to be that a man was hired on hisability as a writer and not on any kind of political affiliations hemight have, and simply as to whether he could do the job or not dothe job.
Mr. TAVENNER. When you were employed by Universal and variousof the other groups, who within those groups were actually responsiblefor your employment ?
Mr. LEES. I really don't know how the ladder of studio officialdomworks, whether the individual producer could make the decision orwhether the story department could make the decision or whether ithad to travel all the way up to Mr. Yates or whoever it might be whowas in charge of the studio. I never quite know where these decisionscome from. I believe that most producers have an autonomy to hirewithin their own story problems, their stories they have been assigned to.
Mr. TAVENNER. With whom did you deal?
Mr. LEES. Oh, sometimes with the story editor and mostly with theproducer directly in charge of that production. And sometimes, well,naturally, after you have been at work on a picture, you do talk withthe director; you do talk with the executive producer, and sometimesyou might even have conferences, I have heard, with the head of thestudio.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you have an associate writer or partner ?
Mr. LEES. I think that's a matter of public record, the associatethat I have worked with. I have been a member of a team for a greatnumber of years.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, who's on the team?
Mr. LEES. I think you could find that out very simply by consultingthe public records. It's on the screen and so forth and so on.
Mr. WooD. Well, do you know ? You know who it is; don't you?
Mr. LEES. Well, I just simply say that this is something that thecommittee is asking me about which, as I said, is a matter of publicrecord, and I think that the committee could find out very simply byconsulting those records. It probably knows by consulting those records already. I'm curious as toMr. WOOD. You're asked to name them.
Mr. LEES. What's that?
Mr. WooD. You're asked who they were. Do you know ?
Mr. LEES. I say that this is a matter of public record. I know whoI collaborated with.
Mr. WooD. Well, would you mind telling the committee? I don'tknow.
Mr. LEES. Is there any particular reason in regard to this question ?
Mr. TAVENNER. A very definite reason.
Mr. LEES. Could you clarify that ?
Mr. TAVENNER. No. I'm asking you to answer the question.
Mr. LEES. On this question I'd like to first give you my reasonswhy I might be claiming this privilege at a future date, and I thinkthe ground should be put in the record. I'm claiming the right notto answer that question on the grounds of the first amendment, whichCOMMUNISM INMOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY199I believe guarantees freedom of belief and expression, and the fifthamendment, which says that a man is not required to testify againsthimself. And for this reason I decline or do not wish to answer thatquestion.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you contend that it might tend to' incriminateyou to state before this committee who are engaged in the writingprofession with you ?
Mr. LEES. Well, I do know this: That there are a great number oforganizations that this committee has deemed to be subversive, andmy connections with any individual that can be connected with theseorganizations can tend to incriminate me, and for this reason I havedeclined to answer that question.
Mr. TAVENNER. You didn't hesitate to answer as to the names ofproducers and various other persons with whom you had conferredin connection with the employment for the writing which you havedone. I can't understand why you claim that to name the individualswho assisted you in the writing might tend to incriminate you.
Mr. LEES. Well, I believe this is a problem that is up to me as anindividual to decide what will incriminate me and what won't, andI so decide at this moment.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, you have your counsel to advise you, but itis certainly outside the law, at least in my personal opinion.
Mr. LEES. What was that again?
Mr. TAVENNER. I said in my personal opinion it's certainly theweight of authority that a witness has not the sole right to determinethat question; that it is a duty resting upon him to give informationto the tribunal, in this case the committee, upon which it might basea decision as to whether or not you should be asked to answer thequestion. You have counsel there. I suggest that you confer withthem.
Mr. LEES. WellMr. Tavenner, on the advice of counsel I stand on the reasons previously stated.
Mr. KEARNEY. Even though you previously stated this was a matter of public record?
Mr. LEES. Well, I saidMr. KEARNEY. Did you state that?
Mr. LEES. What's that, sir?
Mr. KEARNEY. Did you state that?
Mr. LEES. I stated--
Mr. KEARNEY. That the names of your associates were publicrecord ?
Mr. LEES. That's true.
Mr. KEARNEY. And even with it being public record, you declineto answer on the ground that it might incriminate you ?
Mr. LEES. Well, that's true, because of the fact that this committeecan make me testify against myself. This is something I refuse to do.
Mr. KEARNEY. How is that testifying against yourself ?
Mr. LEES. This is my feeling and the feeling of my counsel, andI have taken that advice and I have considered that as correct advice.
Mr. DOYLE. May I ask the witness one question there, please?
Mr. Lees, will you direct my attention to where in the public recordthe names of all our associates with whom you associated may befound?200COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY
Mr. LEES. You can consult theWell, I-what I was trying to point out, Mr. Doyle, was the factthat the committee could find this information, and that drawingthis information from me-the right to find out what the reasonswere-and I found out instead of definite reasons I had a feeling thatthis was something that required my standing on the fifth amendment, which I did. In talking that way previously, I merely wantto say this was no information 'Ifelt that was being withheld fromthe committee's examination that way.
Mr. DOYLE. I can understand that; but now will you answer myquestion? You say it is a matter of public record. Where? As amember of this committee and fellow citizen, I am not familiar withwhere your name has appeared with your associates. Apparentlyyour name appeared with your associate writers voluntarily on yourpart. You're rather proud of them, of the fact that you have madea great success in the profession, and I compliment you on your success. But where may I go if I want to find that record, please?You're not ashamed of the names of those associates, I presume, orthey wouldn't be with your permission a matter of public record.
Mr. LEES. I do decline to answer it because I believe that's the samequestion I declined to answer before, Mr. Doyle.
Mr. DOYLE. Well, very frankly, I figured it was an honest-to-Godway, my question, to ask you a frank, open question. I'm not tryingto trap you. But when you voluntarily allow your name to be associated in the public record on a film or script and tell us that it is apublic record, why then you hesitate to tell us the names of thosepeople or where the record is, I don't savvy.
Mr. LEES. Mr. Doyle, I think you just answered the question yourself. You said here the names can be found.
Mr. DoYLE. Well, where can they be found ?
Mr. LEES. You just said so.
Mr. DOYE. Where?
Mr. LEES. It's in the record at the moment, I believe, if you wantto reexamine the question you just asked.
Mr. DOYLE. What record?
Mr. LEES. I think you answered the question.
Mr. DOYLE. I don't know any record. I haven't seen any recordwhere your associates are listed.
Mr. LEES. Well, Mr. Doyle, I do feel that I have answered the question as clearly as I can, and I have stood on my privilege, and that'sthe best I can do.
Mr. KEARNEY. If you were given the names of those associates,would you admit them ?
Mr. LEES. I have claimed the privilege on that reason.
Mr. WOOD. Further .questions by counsel?
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes, sir.You state that you refuse to answer because to do so might tend toincriminate you. Do you mean that to answer the question as to whowas your associate in writing any of these words, these productions,that to divulge that name might subject you to criminal prosecutionof some kind?
Mr. LEES. I explained my reasons when I first declined to answerthe question.COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY201
Mr. TAVENNER. Have you consulted or collaborated in any of yourwork with an individual by the name of Fred I. Rinaldo ?
Mr. LEES. I refuse to answer the question on the ground previouslystated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you acquainted with an individual by the nameof Elizabeth Leech?

Mr.-LEES. I decline to answer that question on the ground previ-ously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Lees, the committee is in possession of informa-tion indicating that you were issued a registration card No. 47172 in1944 in the Communist Party. In fact, it was-yes; I think that isright-for the year 1945. Were you issued that card, that registrationcard?
Mr. LEES. I decline to answer that question, Mr. Tavenner, on theground previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. In 1944 were you the holder of Communist PoliticalAssociation Book bearing number 4607?
Mr. LEES. I decline to answer that question for the same reasons.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was there issued to you a 1943 Communist Partybook bearing number 25136 ?
Mr. LEES. I decline to answer on the previous grounds, previouslygiven.
Mr. TAVENNER. There was testimony given here before this committee yesterday by Mr. Sterling Hayden. Do you know Mr. Hayden ?
Mr. LEES. I was in the room at the time Mr. Hayden made thatstatement, and I recall him saying something to the effect that he wasa member of some sort of cell that contained back-lot workers, andthe only white-collar worker he knew about was someone namedBernie. And I was surprised when he mentioned the name "RobertLees" in this hearing. And the committee declined or didn't seem tobother to question further Mr. Sterling Hayden on that question.
Mr. WOOD. You are asked now if you know him.
Mr. LEES. What was that?
Mr. WOOD. The question was asked you by counsel if you knowSterling Hayden.
Mr. LEES. Well, I have seen him here at this meeting.
Mr. TAVENNER. You know that wasn't my question. Are you acquainted with Sterling Hayden ?-not whether you have seen him.
Mr. LEES.' Well, on the basis of what happened here the other dayand the name and the questions you're asking me, I decline to answerthat question on the ground previously stated.202COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, you heard his testimony here. Is it true youwere a member of the Communist Party ? Is that true or false?
Mr. LEES. I decline to answer that question, Mr. Tavenner, I havetold you, on the ground previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Have you at any time been a member of the Communist Party ?
Mr. LEES. I decline to answer that statement, Mr. Tavenner.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you now a member of the Communist Party?
Mr. LEES. I decline to answer that statement, Mr. Tavenner, onthe ground previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Have you ever attended meetings of any kind atthe home of Abe Polonsky ?
Mr. LEES. What do you mean by "meetings" ?
Mr. TAVENNER. Meetings. Have you ever been at the home of AbePolonsky when other persons were there ?
Mr. LEES. Well, since I had been in the hearing room the other dayand heard the gentleman mentioned by Mr. Hayden among others,I decline to answer that question for the reason I have given in declining to answer anything about Mr. Hayden previously.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you a subscriber to the Daily People's World,The Worker, and the Daily Worker, or any of them?
Mr. LEES. I believe that there is an addition to a list of organizations that have been deemed subversive quite a number of publicationsthat are also deemed subversive. I believe these publications are onthat list, and I refuse to answer that question on the ground previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Have you made contributions to any of the organizations which you have referred to as having been cited as Communist organizations, including specifically the American Youth forDemocracy?
Mr. LEES. ThatMr. TAVENNER. As one of them ?
Mr. LEES. Mr. Tavenner, is that on your list?
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes; it has been cited.
Mr. LEES. If it's on your list, I decline to answer that. question forthe ground previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Have you made contributions to the People's Educational Center?
Mr. LEES. I see it's on your list, Mr. Tavenner, and I refuse to answer on the ground previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you a delegate to the StateMr. WOOD. Just a moment, Mr. Tavenner. Other members of thecommittee may be better advised on this subject than I am. I didn'tknow that you had a list, Mr. Tavenner.
Mr. LEES. This list that I am looking at here is prepared and re-leased by the Un-American Activities Committee, United StatesHouse of Representatives: Guide to Subversive Organizations andPublications (and Appendix).
Mr. WOOD. You're talking about a list of Mr. Tavenner's.
Mr. LEES. Oh, I'm sorry. I included Mr. Tavenner in this com-mittee. I considered that it was the committee's list. I'm sorry.COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY203
Mr. WooD. I believe the list to which you refer embodied in thispublication issued on March 3, 1951, is the list of organizations thathave been cited by the Attorney GeneralMr. LEES. Oh.
Mr. WOOD (continuing). As Communist-front organizations, aswell as by this committee.
Mr. LEES. I'm talking about the list of organizations that is in thispublication.
Mr. WooD. Is it because of the fact that it is listed there that youdecline to answer the question ?
Mr. LEES. Well, it says "subversive" on the cover of the book.Itcalls these organizations subversive.
Mr. WooD. I asked you is it because it's listed there that you refuseto answer the question.
Mr. LEES. I refuse on the ground previously stated-on thegrounds of the fifth amendment.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you a member of the board of trustees of thePeople's Educational Center in Los Angeles ?
Mr. LEES. I refuse to answer on the ground previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you a delegate to the State Conference onCivil Rights held in San Francisco on August 27 and 28, 1941,which was sponsored by the Northern California Civil Rights Counciland the Southern California Branch of the National Federation forConstitutional Liberties ?

Mr. TAVENNER. Did you attend a political rally of the Fifty-ninthAssembly District Victory Council of the Communist Club of theLos Angeles County Communist PartyMr. LEES. I decline to answer that.
Mr. TAVENNER. Wait a minute. [Continuing] On March 12, 1944,at Marketville in Los Angeles ?
Mr. LEES. I decline to answer that question for the ground previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you know a writer by the name of E. Y. Harburg?
Mr. LEES. Yes; I believe so.
Mr. TAVENNER. DO you recall having attended a benefit party forthe People's World at his home in 1944 .
Mr. LEES. Since that paper is on the list and I have told you thatit has been and my reasons for it, I decline to answer the question onthe ground previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. If the People's World had not been listed in theGuide to Subversive Organizations to which you referred, would youanswer the question.
Mr. LEES. I would then seek the advice of my counsel under thosecircumstances, Mr. Tavenner.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you recall an instance in which the Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee was denied the use of the hotel premisesby the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles in February 19451
Mr. LEES. Would you repeat that again, Mr. Tavenner?
Mr. TAVENNER. I say do you recall the occurrence when the Ambassador Hotel at Los Angeles refused the use of its hotel premises to204COMMUNISM INMOTION-PICTUREthe Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee?INDUSTRYIf it's a question of re-freshing your recollection, I can tell you something more about that.
Mr. LEES. Well, since the organization you refer to is on that list,I decline to answer for grounds previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you protest at the action of the AmbassadorHotel?
Mr. LEES. This is connected with the previous question, and Idecline to answer for the grounds previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you a member of the Joint Anti-FascistRefugee Committee ?
Mr. LEES. There are so many organizations down here, Mr. Taven-ner, that make it impossible for any other answer but the fact that Idecline to answer on the ground previously stated.
Mr. WooD. He's only asking you about the one.
Mr. LEES. What's that, Mr. Wood ?
Mr. WooD. He was only asking you about the one.
Mr. LEES. I know. It's down there. I looked through this.
Mr. WOOD. Well, confine your answer, please, specifically to theorganization about which you were asked.
Mr. LEES. Yes, Mr. Wood.
Mr. WOOD. Do you decline to answer as to that organization ?
Mr. LEES. I decline to answer as to that organization on the groundspreviously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you a member of the Screen Writers' Guild?
Mr. LEES. The Screen Writers' Guild today has a 100 percent guildshop, and every writer who works in Hollywood is a member of theScreen Writers' Guild or almost all.
Mr. TAVENNER. Then do I infer you are a member ?
Mr. LEES. I am.
Mr. TAVENNER. How long have you been a member ?
Mr. LEES. I was a member of the Screen Writers' Guild, I guess,from almost the time that it was made a Screen Writers' Guild by theNLRB election which finally allowed many unions to come into being.I think that was in 1936 the Screen Writers' Guild was founded as it istoday.
Mr. TAVENNER. You recall that a number of personalities in Holly-wood were subpenaed before this committee back in 1947. After thatdate were you a candidate for election to the executive board of theScreen Writers' Guild ?
Mr. LEES. I have been a candidate for the board for the ScreenWriters' Guild on several occasions.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you a candidate in 1948 ?
Mr. LEES. I think-I might have been. I don't know whether thatwas the year I was nominated by the nominating committee of theScreen Writers' Guild, but I have been nominate., as I say, for theboard of the Screen Writers' Guild on several occasions. It mightvery well have been in 1948 I was also nominated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Have you sought election to that board since 1947?
Mr. LEES. Since 1947 ?
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes.
Mr. LEES. I don't know. Actually what happens is the nominatingcommittee puts your name up, and if you're willing to run you run,and if you're elected you're elected. I don't know if the nominatingcommittee has had my name up since then or not.NISM 1 IN MOTION-PICTURECOMM1
Mr.TAVENNER.INDUSTRY205Well, at least you have not been elected to the boardsince 1947; have you ?
Mr. LEES. No. I have never been elected to the board actually.
Mr. TAVENNER. The Hollywood Writers' Mobilization was an or-ganization brought into being during the period of the war; was itnot?
Mr. LEES. Well, the Hollywood Writers' Mobilization is on that list,and I decline to answer further questions about that organization onthe ground previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. YOU refuse to state what your connection was withthat organization?
Mr. LEES. I refuse to answer the question on the grounds previouslystated, Mr. Tavenner.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you write a script on the subject of atomicenergy for the Atomic Energy Commission of the Hollywood Writers'Mobilization which was intended for a transcontinental radio program?
Mr. LEES. This is connected with the previous question concerningthe organization, and I decline to answer for the ground previouslystated.
Mr. TAVENNER. You decline to answer whether you prepared a scriptfor that organization ?
Mr. LEES. That's right.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you a member of the Actors' LaboratoryTheater?
Mr. LEES. That organization is also listed, and I decline to answerfor-the ground I previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. I believe there was filed in the Supreme Court ofthe United States in the case of John Howard Lawson and DaltonTrumbo a brief in behalf of Alexander Meiklejohn and certain otherpersons as amicus curiae.-- Were you one of the persons in whose namethis brief was filed ?
Mr. LEES. Will you repeat that question again ? An amicus curiaebrief?
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes.
Mr. LEES. I think, as I recall, I might have been. Will you repeatthat question again, please, Mr. Tavenner? Amicus curiae brief to theSupreme Court?
Mr. TAVENNER. That's right.
Mr. LEES. That's right. I believe I did sign it.
Mr. TAVENNER. Who sought your signature to that brief?
Mr. LEES. I actually don't recall who sought my signature to thatbrief. I know that it was about, and I was very anxious to ask theSupreme Court to render a decision in the case of. the Hollywood 10,which the Supreme Court has not done. And I feel that the questionsof the first amendment that were involved in that case really shouldhave been decided by the Supreme Court of the United States.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was there any Communist Party connection as faras you know with the movement to present that brief?
Mr. LEES. This question involves an organization which is on yourlist, and .I decline to answer the question on the grounds previouslystated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Albert Maltz was one of the individuals who appeared before this committee in 1947 and was a defendant in a con-206COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRYtempt proceeding. After that time, namely, in 1949, were you thesigner of a petition to have him elected to membership on the boardof the Screen Writers' Guild?
Mr. LEES. Yes. I signed that petition.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was he elected?
Mr. LEES. No; he was not that I recall.
Mr. TAVENNER. Has the Screen Writers' Guild to your knowledgemade an effort to remove not from membership but to curtail theactivities of persons thought to be members of the Communist Partywithin its group ?
Mr. LEES. I don't know how, in what way, I could know about this,whether they have curtailed or tried to curtail. I don't know.
Mr. TAVENNER. You do not know ?
Mr. LEES. Not that I know of. I might say that there is a statement of policy in the Screen Writers' Guild which says that anyonecan be a member of the Screen Writers' Guild without any ban because of race, creed, religion, political beliefs, something similar tothe first amendment. Nobody is required to be anything but a writerto join the Screen Writers' Guild.
Mr. TAVENNER. Has there at any time in the past been a group orgroups within that organization which from your viewpoint wereendeavoring to influence the action of that guild along CommunistParty lines or in Communist Party interests ?
Mr. LEES. Well, the question that you have asked involves an organization on the list that I have before me here, and I decline toanswer that question on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. You do not by your reply mean to indicate that theScreen Writers' Guild has ever been listed as a Communist organization ?
Mr. LEES. I simply answered the question as you represented it, andI don't know what implication-can you repeat it ?
Mr. TAVENNER. Then, let us make certain as to what you mean,because I understood you to say you refused to answer because theorganization appeared on the list of subversive organizations.
Mr. LEES. Oh, I see what you mean. No. The organization thatyou have mentioned along with the Screen Writers' Guild in thequestion.
Mr. TAVENNER. In other words, by reason of my reference to theCommunist PartyMr. LEES. That's
Mr. TAVENNER (continuing). You would not answer ?
Mr. LEES. I refer to that organization.
Mr. TAVENNER. You do not mean to imply--Mr. LEES. I certainly do not mean to imply-Mr. TAVENNER (continuing). That the Screen Writers' Guild is aCommunist organization ?
Mr. LEES. I don't think it's been listed in any of your organizations,but anything is possible in this day and age.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, do you mean that it's possible that the ScreenWriters' Guild is a Communist organization?
Mr. LEES. It's not a Communist organization, Mr. Tavenner.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you certain?
Mr. LEES. As I understand it.COMMUNISM INMOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY207
Mr. TAVENNER. And you did not mean to infer that it was by youranswer ?
Mr. LEES. I do not mean to infer that it was, but I did mean that it'spossible for any labor union or any organization at some future dateperhaps to be listed. That's all I meant.
Mr. TAVENNER. Have you any reason to believe that this organiza-tion would ever be listed as a Communist-front organization?
Mr. LEES. I have no reason to believe that. Neither have I hadreason to believe that some of the organizations or other organizations that have been listed could have been listed. Since that's beenpossible, almost any organization can become suspect.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, will you refer by name to any organizationwhich you did not have reason to believe would be cited and whichhas been?
Mr. LEES. I decline to get into the discussion of organizations thathave been listed, because I cannot, unfortunately, because of involvingmyself and incriminating myself.
Mr. TAVENNER. Referring again to the play Meet the Invisible Man,is it ifot true that Frederick I. Rinaldo was a joint writer with you inthat screen play ?
Mr. LEES. I refuse to answer that question on the ground previouslystated.
Mr. KEARNEY. Even in view of the fact it's public knowledge ?
Mr. LEES. I think this is all a matter of record.
Mr. KEARNEY. I didn't ask you what you thought. Will you pleaseanswer my question?
Mr. LEES. I mean I was referring to earlier questions on this subject where I have claimed the privilege, and I am claiming the privilege on exactly the same basis that I claimed it before.
Mr. KEARNEY. I would like to ask one more question.
Mr. TAVENNER. I have no further questions.
Mr. KEARNEY. TO your knowledge, are any of the convicted Hollywood 10 writers now working for the motion-picture industry ?
Mr. LEES. Not to my knowledge.
Mr. WooD. Any further questions?
Mr. KEARNEY. NO.
Mr. WOOD. Mr. Velde?
Mr. VELDE. Mr. Lees, is it L-e-e-s ?
Mr. LEES. That's correct.
Mr. VELDE. You have refused to answer quite a number of verypertinent questions on the grounds that it might tend to incriminateyou. I wonder if you honestly feel that you are more in danger ofbeing incriminated by refusing to answer than you would in answering truthfully ?
Mr. LEES. Would you repeat that again, please ? I'm sorry.
Mr. VELDE. Do you honestly feel that you would be more in dangerof being incriminated by refusing to answer these pertinent questionsthan you would be by answering them truthfully?
Mr. LEES. May I point out that as I understand the use and theprivilege of the fifth amendment is such that drawing inferences asto guilt or nonguilt by claiming the privilege is something that is notcorrect.
Mr. VELDE. Well, you realize, of course, Mr. Lees, this is not a courtof law. I maan we can't possibly prosecute you as a defendant.208COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRYThis is an investigative body of the Congress, and as such it is chargedwith the duty of gathering information about subversive, disloyalactivities of the United States. You realize that, don't you?
Mr. LEES. I realize that the committee is functioning along its linesof investigating what it considers subversive.of the committee.These are the opinionsAnd I have opinions about subversion or nonsub-version or what is democratic or what is patriotic, and those are myopinions. I think we're getting into a matter of opinion.
Mr. VELDE. Apparently you have an idea that admission of Cornmunist Party membership would tend to incriminate you. You haveso refused to- answer questions about your membership on that. basis,Do you want this committee to assume'that there is something moresubversive or that you know of other activities that are more subversive than being a member of the Communist Party, or do you knowof activities that the Communist Party is engaged in that are moresubversive ?
Mr. LEES. I have just stated I don't think it is correct for thiscommittee to assume on the basis of the fact that I have taken a standon this amendment, and that is what I said, and you have just pointedout that you're assuming something which I don't want to be assumed.
Mr. VELDE. It's a question of whether or not you feel that thereis actual danger of you being prosecuted as a result of your truthfulanswers here.
Mr. LEEs. Well, I believe that in claiming the privilege on the basisof self-incrimination or on the basis that I might tend to incriminatemyself makes that quite clear.
Mr. VELDE. Well, can you mention anyone who has been incrimi-nated by this committee by answering questions truthfully?
Mr. LEES. I think this is a matter of personal feeling on the subjectsand, as I say I don't think you should assume from my answers anything other than what is said.
Mr. VELDE. There have been quite a number of cooperative witnesses-who admitted to this committee that they have been members of theCommunist Party and have answered the questions to the best oftheir ability. Have any of those in your knowledge been prosecutedfor any type of crime whatsoever?
Mr. LEES. I don't know actually what's happened in prosecution, butI do know that there has been a great deal' of reaction generally topeople who have come before this committee and have cooperated withit. I know that there has been all kind of problems. I know thatpeople who are-simply subpenaed by this committee have found themselves blacklisted or no longer able to work. I figure there's all kindsof jeopardy involved in this committee, either whether you're friendlyor not.
Mr. VELDE. There's quite a difference between incrimination by pub-lic opinion and incrimination by a court of law.
Mr. LEES. I'm not a lawyer on that subject. I don't know. But Ido know I have claimed the privilege in the way I understand it,and that's why I have claimed it.
Mr. VELDE. Do you state whether or not you know AbrahamPolonsky ?
Mr. LEES. Could I be refreshed by counsel?Oh, I declined, I gather. I declined.COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY209
Mr. VELDE. And do you now decline to state whether ydu areacquainted with him ?
Mr. LEES. I still decline to state on the basis that I have previouslystated.
Mr. VELDE. Was Abraham Polonsky engaged in some kind of dis-loyal or subversive activities that would cause your admission ofacquaintance with him to make you refuse to answer on the ground ofself-incrimination?
Mr. LEES. Well, as I said, when we discussed this previously or whenthis subject was brought up, that that name was brought into thiscommittee by an informer. I believe that puts me or anyone elseinvolved in connection with this person in a position whereby he can beincriminated.
Mr. KEARNEY. Did I understand you to say "brought before thiscommittee by an informer" ?
Mr. LEES. Well, as I feel-
Mr. KEARNEY. Or by someone who was telling the truth ?
Mr. LEES. Well, I don't know how to get into this discussion as towhat is truth or what is informing or what isn't, but I do knowMr. KEARNEY. I will say for the benefit of the gentleman testify-ing that the whole line of testimony of all these witnesses who haveappeared before this committee seems to have a particular pattern withreference to the word "informer."
Mr. VELDE. I just have one more question.Are you acquaintedwith Sylvia Morrow?
Mr. LEES. What was that name again?
Mr. VELDE. Sylvia Morrow.
Mr. LEES. I don'tMr. VELDE. I think she's the former wife or possibly at the presenttime of Abraham Polonsky.
Mr. LEES. Well, if this is connected with the same question that Ihave refused to answer for reasons I have stated previously, I refuseon the same basis.
Mr. VELDE. That's all, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. WooD. Mr. Jackson?
Mr. JACKSON. No questions.
Mr. WooD. Mr. Doyle?
Mr. DOYLE. Mr. Lees, you feel you're really informed and ac-quainted with the purposes of this committee before which you're awitness now ? Do you really feel you are ?
Mr. LEES. Informed on this committee?
Mr. DOYLE. Yes.
Mr. LEES. In what way?
Mr. DOYLE. Well, do you feel you know what the purpose of thiscommittee is ? Let me ask it this way: If you feel you are informedof the purpose of this congressional committee, tell me, please, whatyou think the purpose of this committee is under the law. What arewe trying to do ? What is our purpose?
Mr. LEES. Well, I don't know why you're asking me what you'retrying to do. Actually I think that is something you know-whatyou're trying to do.If it's a matter of information on this, I havefine legal advice here that would be21()COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY
Mr. DOYLE. I know, but they are both brilliant lawyers, I happen toknow. I happen to know that you are a very brilliant writer apparently and a very brilliant witness.
Mr. LEES. Thank you, Mr. Doyle.
Mr. DOYLE. And you and I were born in a great State, by the way.
Mr. LEES. We were.
Mr. DOYLE. But I'm wondering if you are under any misapprehension as to the purpose, objectives or good faith of this committee. I'mkind of under the impression that perhaps you don't know what thepurpose of this committee is, and I'm not asking that, Lees, to embarrass you, to try to trick or trap you. I'm talking with you as oneAmerican to another. But I'm wondering if you really know what weare trying to do as a committee.
Mr. LEES. Well, Mr. Doyle, I'm glad you have asked me this aues-.tion as one American to anotherMr. DOYLE. All right.
Mr. LEES (continuing). Because as an American I have very definiteviews about certain policies in the past and what has been said ihonltthis committee, the activities of this committee.
Mr. DOYLE. I mean, What is the purpose of it as this session inCongress?
Mr. LEES. I know what has been listed organizationwise. I knowthe number of people who have been blacklisted. I know the numberof people who no longer can work. I know the number of careersthat have been completely destroyed. I know a great number ofthings that have happened.
Mr. KEARNEY. IS that due to the company they kept?
Mr. LEES. All I know is that these people are respected citizens,and I have been living a very respectable and very, very upright life.I have been born in a great State and lived in that State, as Mr. Doylehas just pointed out. And I feel that 17 years of work in the motionpicture industry of which I have devoted my time and my effort hasbeen destroyed by this committee.
Mr. DOYLE. Now, I would assure you that as a member of the committee there is no purpose or intent to destroy the career of any person nor. harm any person. But as long as it appears you rely uponyour counsel because you haven't had the time or taken the time toread the law and the jurisdiction of this committee, let me just quotethe purpose of it, if I may, to you and see if you are in accord with thissort of purpose.Under Public Law 601 the Committee on Un-American Activitiesas a whole or by subcommittee is authorizedto make from time to time investigations of the extent, character, and objectsof un-American propaganda activities in the United States.Do you or do you not feel that that is a worthy purpose?
Mr. LEES. Mr. Doyle, I have my opinion on what constitutes disloyal activities, and I base my opinion on the first amendment, and Iconsider disloyal activities that abridge anyone's right to speak or tojoin organizations of his free will, any rights of religion or beliefs,and I know some organizations that do persecute people because oftheir religion or their beliefs. I know of organizations that havepersecuted people because of their race.
Mr. DOYLE. So do I.'COMMUNISMIN MOTION-PICTURE (INDUSTRY211
Mr. LEEs. I believe that these organizations infringe on the rights ofthe American people in the first amendment and I feel that any infringements on the rights of the first amendment must be defendedand the organizations that do these things must be attacked.On this basis I clearly see the right of this committee to attack thoseorganizations and to ferret those organizations out, as I understandthe first amendment and the right of the people under the first amendment.
Mr. DOYLE. A few minutes ago you stated, "I have opinion of whatis subversive and what is not." Do you remember so stating? And,of course, perhaps we all do that, try to be patriotic citizens. We aretrying to arrive at some fair conclusion as to what subversive is andwhat it is not.Now, let me ask you again, Mr. Lees. I don't think you answeredmy question. I don't want to be unfair with you nor press it unduly,but in view of your voluntary statement a few minutes ago, and Iquote, "I have opinion what is subversive and what is not"-youweren't pressed for that statement. You volunteered that statementjust a few minutes ago. I wrote it down. I think I wrote it downverbatim. Do you remember so stating?
Mr. LEES. I believe that's correct.
Mr. DOYLE. All right. If we are in agreement on that I will askyou again. The law says that we are authorized by the Congress ofthe United States to examine into the extent, character, and objects ofun-American activities in the United States.
Mr. LEES. Yes.
Mr. DOYLE. Now, assuming, therefore, that we are today examining--Mr. LEEs. Are you asking me to assume that, Mr. Doyle, I mean?
Mr. DOYLE. Yes; I'm asking you.
Mr. LEES. Because why I said my opinion was on the first amendment is that I felt that there were a great number of things underthe first amendment that were being infringed upon by organizations,and because these organizations were not attacked, were not broughthere, were not exposed by this committee, I do not feel that this committee was doing the thing that you say that they should be doing.
Mr. DOYLE. In other words, you don't feel to date we have done athorough enough job? Is that correct?
Mr. LEES. I feel that for a great number of years that this committee has failed to go ahead and do the job that the
Mr. DOYLE. All right.
Mr. LEES (continuing). That the statement you make there is, ac-cording to my interpretation, of the Bill of Rights.
Mr. DOYLE. All right. Now, Mr. Lees, do you feel that that statement in the law, just the statement I have read you, to examine andinvestigate into the extent, character, and objects of un-Americanpropaganda activities in the United States, is a worthy objective?
Mr. LEES. According to the way I see it, I think that the exposureof any infringement of the first amendment is a worthy objective.
Mr. DOYIE. Well, now, is that your final answer to that question?
Mr. LEES. Yes; that is the final answer.
Mr. DOYLE. Now, let me go to the next section. This committeethen is also charged with examining, investigating the diffusion with81595-51-pt. 1-11212COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRYin the United States of subversive and un-American propaganda asinstigated from foreign countries. Do you feel that is a worthy objective of the committee of the Congress or not?
Mr. LEES. Un-American propaganda in terms of what?
Mr. DOYLE. Well, you said you had your opinion of what is subversive.
Mr. LEEs. I base my opinion on what I can clearly see is subversion of the Constitution, which is the rights, as I understand them,of freedom of religion, speech, thought, press-Mr. DoYLE. Well-Mr. LEES (continuing). Rights of trial by jury. I could go on ifyou want.
Mr. DOLE. In other words, in your opinion what is subversive conduct?
Mr. LEES. Well, I think actually if you ask my opinion on this,which you have, I think where subversion becomes a matter of opinionor the fact that a man has said something that you disagree with, Idon't think that disagreement should put a man in a position of notbeing an American, because I feel that disagreement is the only waythat this country has ever grown. There has been disagreement, forexample, with General MacArthur today, and what's happened hasbeen the result of a discussion back and forth and conclusions madethrough disagreement. I believe if no agreement was made or disagreement allowed to be hadMr. DOYE. May I ask: You don't think for one minute that thiscommittee or any member of it is interested in holding subversive aperson just because we disagree with that person ?
Mr. LEES. I don't know about that.That's what bothers me.
Mr. DoYLE. I want to set you right. That's a lot of baloney.
Mr. LEES. I'm glad to hear that. I'm still somewhat bothered.
Mr. DOYLE. As one American to another, I want to tell you it's alot of baloney when somebody tells you that this committee of Congress is interested in persecuting or holding a person subversive justbecause they differ with that person. I have one more question.
Mr. LEEs. All right, Mr. Doyle. I would like to give you an opinionon that.
Mr. DOYLE. I asked you for your opinion.
Mr. LEES. I'd like to continue.
Mr. DOYLE. Now, one step more. I'm reading from the law, tryingto get an honest-to-God answer from you.
Mr. LEE. I'm giving you that, Mr. Doyle.
Mr. DOYLE (reading):* * * or subversive propaganda of a domestic origin and which attacksthe principles of the form of government as guaranteed by our Constitution.Now, don't you feel that is a worthy objective and a necessary function in the United States Congress that we investigate into ways andmeans which are devised and used to upset if need be by force theform of American constitutional government? Aren't we justified?Aren't we charged with that duty as American Congressmen ?
Mr. LEES. I think the upholding of the Constitution is not onlythe job of a Congressman; it is the job of every citizen in this country.
Mr. DOYLE. Well, then, you would agree with me that we should goevery honest-to-God limit within the law to find out who is subversiveand what organizations are subversive and what are not, wouldn't you ?COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY213
Mr. LEES. As I defined very clearly, I hope, what I consider sub-version, and since you're asking me my opinion, Mr. Doyle, I can onlygive you my opinion.
Mr. DOYLE. That's all I want.
Mr. LEES. My feeling is that subversion involves abridgments ofthe first amendment. When there is no abridgment of the first amendment, where it comes an area in which there is no question of a matterof free speech or certain rights guaranteed by the American people,I believe there becomes a very clear line between what is
Mr. DOYLE. Wouldn't you feel
Mr. LEES (continuing). Abridging one's right.
Mr. DOYLE. Wouldn't you feel, Mr. Lees, that if there was any person or organization which propagandized that it was 0. K. if necessary to upset the American constitutional form of government byforce, that that person or organization was subversive and ought tobe smoked out and be stamped for what they are, or not?
Mr. LEES. Well, the point is in this question what involves forceand violence and what's being said here by this question in terms of-let me put it this way: I think that any action of force or violenceagainst this country should be treated and is treated as a breaking ofthe law by the forces that are in charge of the law.
Mr. DOYLE. You have heard Mr. Hayden on yesterday. You saidyou were in the room here. I think you said you had been here acouple of days and heard all the testimony. That's good, because itgives you the benefit and the committee the benefit of your testimonyin light of the fact that you have heard all the testimony for a coupleof days.I am now reminding you that you heard the testimony of Mr. Hayden, an actor from Hollywood, in answer to my question I think itwas. I asked him in substance whether or not it was his opinion thatthe Communist Party in the United States had as one of its objectivesthe overthrow of the constitutional form of government in the UnitedStates by force if necessary. Do you remember that question
Mr. LEES. Yes.
Mr. DOYLE. Your answer is "Yes." You remember he said that hisanswer was "Yes."Do you remember that?
Mr. LEES. Yes.
Mr. DoLE. All right. Would you feel that in view of that sort oftestimony from a former Communist and admitted Communist thatthis committee is doing any less than its full duty toward the Americanpeople to go every legal limit to ferret out every member of the Communist Party in the United States and to smoke out the ways andmeans which they devise and use to overthrow the constitutional formof government by force if necessary, as Hayden testified ?
Mr. LEES. Mr. Doyle, you're now getting onto a question which Ifeel throughout the testimony here I have claimed the privilege, because of this kind of organization and other organizations beingbranded as subversive, and I feel, although I would like to discussthese questions with you at length, that this in a sense can be selfincriminating, and I decline to answer that question.
Mr. DOYLE. Mr. Lees, this is my final statement or question. Onereason I have asked you these questions involving more or less thephilosophy of certain thinking is that I wanted to try to convince youif I could as a much younger man that this committee is not interested214COMMUNISM INMOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRYin persecuting anybody, not you, not even the Communist Party. Weare interested in fulfilling our responsibilities to the American people,which charges us with ferreting out and discovering and bringing before the law, as you stated, every person and every organization thatis interested, has an objective in upsetting by force if necessary theAmerican form of government. And I hope you will go back to Hollywood and to my native State with a firm knowledge of the fact thatthis committee is not apparently functioning the way you thought itwas functioning when you came here as a witness. In other words,we are not interested in persecuting.
Mr. LEES. WellMr. DOYLE. I want to try to convince you of that as a much youngerman.
Mr. LEES. Mr. Doyle, I would like to go back to California andbelieve that, but I am going back to California and I know otherwitnesses and other people who have been before this committeemaybe can't go back to California because there's no point in goingback there because they can no longer work in the motion-picture industry, and they might try to find a job somewhere else. I don'tknow how you term this, as persecution or what, but I feel that thiscertainly comes under the heading of some kind of pressure that cancan be termed "blacklist," if you will, and that I don't feel that a black-list denying people employment for. whatever political beliefs theymight hold is American.
Mr. DOYLE. Not even if those people directly or indirectly areinterested in using force and violence to upset the constitutional formof government in this country as testified to yesterday by your fellow actor Hayden?
Mr. LEES. I said this-I have to make myself very clear about this.I said that anyone who uses force or violence should be treated by theproper authorities.
Mr. DOYLE. All right.
Mr. LEES. I also stated that matters of opinion are sacred underour first amendment, and when you go into the area of thoughtand, believe me, I as a writer make my living in the area of thoughtin the matter of research, in the matter of reading, in the matter of allthese things, I feel that any infringement on perhaps opinions orthoughts which this committee or some other future committee mightdeem suddenly un-American becomes a very dangerous thing in thiscountry. Very dangerous.
Mr. DOYLE. Well, one question more.Don't you think, in viewof your statement, that you felt that persons who had the philosophyof overthrowing this Government by force if necessary should bebrought before the bar of the law and prosecuted within the law,in view of that statement by you, don't you think it is our duty asAmerican Congressmen charged with this responsibility by all of theCongress to find out who those persons are in a public session likethis and then see to it they are prosecuted within the law? That'swhat you have just stated, isn't it?
Mr. LEES. I stated a matter of action.As far as getting into therealms of what people believe, if a matter of advocating these things,of trying to talk about these things in teims of destroying our Constitution, as I have said before, I'm a great upholder and believerin our Constitution.COMMUNISM INMOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY215
Mr. DOYLE. Then do I understand that a courteous answer to me,and I appreciate your courteous answer-do I understand then thatyou feel that if members of the Communist Party, as an American,as testified to by your fellow actor Hayden, just talk about overthrowing the United States of America by force, that is O. K. aslong as they don't take any action to- do it? You differentiatedjust now in action and talking. Do I understand that that is yourMr. LEES. Mr. Doyle, I did get into this discussion with you before,and you have now gone again to that area where discussion becomesimpossible, and I'm sorry I must claim my privilege not to get intothat discussion, in the same way I have claimed my privilege allthrough this hearing.
Mr. DOYLE. Thank you very much.I want to say again, Mr. Chairman, and I want to emphasize this,that I think that some of these folks from Hollywood, my nativeState, as well as other places, are under a firm conviction, whateverthe reason is, that this committee is interested in persecuting ratherthan protecting our Nation. I want to say to you again, Mr. Lees, Ihope wherever you go that I have a question mark in your mind as tothe accuracy of that, because it's damnably false. And I wouldn'tbe on this committee for 30 seconds if I felt the objective of this committee was to persecute any person or any group of persons in America.But I am also firmly under the conviction that it is the duty of thiscommittee and it is your duty as an American citizen to help thiscommittee ferret and smoke out any person that is interested in usingforce to overthrow the constitutional form of government of theUnited States.Thank you very much.
Mr. KEARNEY. Mr. Chairman, I move we adjourn.
Mr. WooD. Any further questions, Mr. Counsel ?
Mr. TAVENNER. No, sir.
Mr. WooD. The committee will recess until 10 o'clock in the morning.

Mr. WooD.

Mr. TAVENNER. How have you been employed since the completionof your educational training ?
Mr. COLLINS. Well, I worked as a clerk at Bloomingdale's in 1935,I think it was. Then as an outside reader for Columbia Pictures inNew York. Then junior writer for Twentieth-Century Fox the end of1936 and 1937. Then for Universal, Selznick's, Paramount, about1939, for a year. Then for RKO for a short time. Universal for about6 months.

Then for Robert Rossen Productions. Then for Roberts Productions. Then for Sidney Buchman Enterprises. Thenagain for Roberts Productions.(Representative Harold H. Velde entered hearing room.)
Mr. TAVENNER. IS that where you are now employed?
Mr. COLLINs. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you state to the committee what particularscreen plays you have worked on in the past 3 or 4 years ?
Mr. COLLINs. I haven't worked on any produced screen plays in thelast 3 or 4 years.
Mr. TAVENNER. What were the last?
Mr. COLLINS. They go way back-to 1943 or 1944, to As ThousandsCheer and Song of Russia.
Mr. TAVENNER. Where were you living in 1935 ?
Mr. COLLINS. In New York.
Mr. TAVENNER. And how long did you live there at that time ?
Mr. COLLINS. About a year, I think.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you come to New York from the west coast?
Mr. COLLINS. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. Had you been employed on the west coast prior tothat time, or had you been in school?
Mr. COLLINs. I had been in school.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was your reason for coming to New York
Mr. COLLINS. My family moved to New York and I moved withthem.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you continue any course of training while inNew York at that time?
Mr. COLLINS. I went to the New Theater League School in NewYork. The New Theater League School was a theater school, and,unlike most schools of the theater, it didn't cost very much to go to it.It was a left-wing theater group, and it was kind of active, open toyoung people, and there was a great deal of' experimentation in it ofvarious-kinds, and I was pretty excited by it and went to school thereabout 6 months.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you have a scholarship ?
Mr. COLLINS. Toward the end of the time I think I did. I usedabout a month of it and then came back to California.
Mr. TAVENNER. While you were in attendance at that school, didanything occur as a result of which you became a member of the YoungCommunist League?COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY219
Mr. COLLINS. Yes. I signed an application blank for this scholarship and said I was interested in the Young Communist League, andsomeone, I don't remember who, got in touch with me, and I went toone meeting of the Young Communist League in New York. That wasthe full extent of my experience in the Young Communist League.
Mr. TAVENNER. Then you went to the west coast after the completion of that training?
Mr. COLLINS. That is right.
Mr. TAVENNER. Upon arriving on the west coast, did you resumeyour affiliation with the Young Communist League or with any Communist Party groups or individuals?
Mr. COLLINS. No, I didn't get in touch with the Young CommunistLeague, but I was introduced to a class in Marxism. I don't rememberthe nature of the class. It could have been political economy or somethink like that.
Mr. TAVENNER. Tell us how that occurred.
Mr. COLLINS. Well, there was a man that I met who had been inRussia and was very enthusiastic about it. His name was BuddSchulberg.
Mr. WooD. I didn't get the name.
Mr. COLLINS. Budd Schulberg.
Mr. VELDE. Will you spell that, please?
Mr. COLLINS. It is S-c-h-u-l-b-e-r-g, I think. He had been, as Isay, in Russia, and was very interested and excited by what he saw,and he introduced me to a class which met in a small frame housebehind somebody's house. I think the house belonged to a man namedMullins. What his first name was, I don't know. Mullins was a manwho used to go around studios with books and pictures. I stayed inthis class a while, was interested, and that was the extent of the class.
Mr. TAVENNER. It was a study group on Marxism ?
Mr. COLLINS. That is right, and I imagine they were mainly nonCommunists. It was a class, I presume, to bring people closer to theCommunist Party.
Mr. TAVENNER. About how many composed the class ?
Mr. COLLINS. I think four or five.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you remember the names?
Mr. COLLINS. No, outside of Mullins I don't remember. I don't evenremember the teacher's name.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you come in contact with any of them in connection with Communist Party activities at any later date?
Mr. COLLINS. No.
Mr. TAVENNER. At that time how were you employed?
Mr. COLLINS. I am not sure that I was employed at that particularmoment, or, rather, that particular 6 months.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was your first employment?
Mr. COLLINS. My first employment was as a junior writer, TwentiethCentury-Fox. That didn't occur until late in 1936, I think about thelast month of 1936 or beginning of 1937.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was the approximate date of your arrival inHollywood?
Mr. COLLINS. The summer of 1936. So, therefore, you see, I startedthis class before I was employed.
Mr. TAVENNER. After you had been in this class a period of time,did you become associated with a group of writers ?220COMMUNISM INMOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY
Mr. COLmuS. Well, no. That came, I think, probably, out of thefact that I went to work as a writer. I did then become associatedwith a group of writers.
Mr. TAVENNER. Tell us what the occasion of that association was.
Mr. COLuLs. In order to tell you that I would have to tell yousomething about the Screen Writers' Guild.
Mr. TAVENNER. Very well.
Mr. Co.LLIN. The Screen Writers' Guild, as I understand it-thiswas before I came to Hollywood-was smashed by the Screen Playwrights, a right-wing group of writers. The Screen Playwrightsbroke the guild up on the charge that it was becoming dominated bythe Authors' League, which, according to Screen Playwrights, was aRed-dominated group. So the cry of eastern domination was thething that broke up the Screen Writers' Guild.In order to break it up the Screen Playwrights, the right-winggroup, had full support of the studios. With the pressure of thestudios and the fear of blacklisting, the Screen Writers' Guild wassmashed, but the majority of writers didn't support the Screen Playwrights and weren't very happy with them. The Screen Playwrightsgot a contract as a company union, and, therefore, they were the representatives of the writers in Hollywood at the time.There was a group of people, as I understood it at the time and asI believe today, Conununists and non-Communists, who met underthe leadership or guidance of V. J. -Jerome. And I think it is interesting, because I have seen it happen since, that the right wing in thiscase, the extreme right wing, made it possible for the left wing, for theCommunists, particularly, to take advantage of a situation that already existed. As a matter of fact, unless a situation exists, I don'tthink Communists or anybody else can take advantage of it.This group met for the purpose of reconstituting the Screen WritersGuild. And I think I ought to make it very clear that the reconstitution of the Screen Writers' Guild was a dangerous thing at that timebecause the fear of blacklisting was very strong.The group had met before I came. How long, I don't know. Theymet for about 3 months afterwards. As I remember, these meetingswere very long, very drawn-out. Tremendous arguments took placein them, although I don't remember what about, and usually V. J.won, because he had more energy than anybody else.
Mr. TAVENNER. By "V. J." you are speaking of V. J. Jerome?
Mr. CourNs. Yes. He was able to outlast us all so far as his arguments were concerned. He was the most persistent of all of us.
Mr. TAVENNER. These meetings to which you refer were meetingscomposed of persons who were both Communists and non-Communists ?
Mr. CoLLins. That is correct.
Mr. TA*ENNER. And, as I understand, they were meeting under thedirection and guidance of V. J. Jerome ?
Mr. COLLINs. The point is that the writers had no background fororganizing a union, and presumably V. J. Jerome had a lot of experience along this line, and he was the logical man to lead theorganization, especially in view of the pressure from the employers.This was something that V. J. knew something about, so he was thelogical man for people to turn to.COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY221
Mr. TAVENNER. Would you say the group was organized becauseof the efforts of the Communist Party ?
Mr. COLLINS. You mean the Screen Writers' Guild?
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes.
Mr. COLLINS. Yes, it was.The Screen Writers' Guild, as I remem-ber it, I think that John Howard Lawson took V. J. Jerome's place,and after he took his place there were a series of 8 or 9 meetingscalled at various people's houses the same night, and to each of thesemeetings 20 or 30 writers were invited, and therefore the ScreenWriters' Guild was organized the same night with about 200 people,enough writers so that the fear of reprisals from the producers couldin some degree be abated.
Mr. TAVENNER. I am not certain I understand clearly the methodused to get the Screen Writers' Guild organized through the separatemeetings you spoke of. What do you mean by separate meetings, andwhat was the purpose of holding separate meetings?
Mr. COLLINS. I find it difficult to remember what the purpose was,but I presume the idea was to have small enough meetings so thatthere wouldn't be a great deal of publicity about it, which there certainly would be if you pulled 200 writers together. So instead ofhaving 200 writers meet at one point, they came together the samenight at different houses. With each group I imagine there was onewho- had been in the meetings with V. J. Jerome, who knew whatthe demands were and therefore was able to present something toreform the Screen Writers' Guild.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you one of the group and therefore one of theinitial members of the reorganized Screen Writers' Guild?
Mr. COLINs. Oh, yes; that is right.
Mr. TAVENNER. I am going to question you about this further later,but I want at this moment to ask you a question as to whether or notthe Communist influence within the Screen Writers' Guild, whichresulted in its reorganization, has continued on to the present timewith the same force and effect ?
Mr. COLLINS. Well, no. I think one of the things that I was proudof in those days as a Communist, and that the other Communists wereproud of, I suppose, was that we had recognized the Screen Writers'Guild, and that the majority of the screen writers wanted the ScreenWriters' Guild, and therefore a noncompany union that really reflectedthe desires of the screen writers was set up. In subsequent years it istrue the Communists had something to say about how the guild wasrun, because there were Communists on the board and in the guild, andbecause the line they' pursued was not too far from what the memberswanted, they were able to exert some influence. This influence has beenpretty much finished since 1947.
Mr. TAVENNER. In your opinion, do I understand that the influenceof the Communist Party in the guild has been dissipated?
Mr. COLLINS. Yes; I would say that is true since the 1947 election,which occurred after the first hearings here, or during the hearings.
Mr. TAVENNER. I will ask you more questions about that later. Youhave told us about the reorganization of the guild under the leadershipof V. J. Jerome. You mentioned the name of John Howard Lawson.To what extent did he participate in the management or the operationof the guild, and how did he figure in the picture222COMMUNISM INMOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY
Mr. COLLINS. John Howard Lawson is an extremely forceful manon his own, as a speaker and as a man who spreads opinions. For agreat many years he had a great deal of weight with the membership ofthe guild. He was also, I think, accepted, whether he was in all casesofficially or not, as a leader or the leader of the Communist Party inHollywood; so, therefore, he had some influence. And he had influence because of his own personality, courage, intellectual capacity, andso on.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did he supplant any other person in leadership inthe Communist Party in Hollywood ?
Mr. COLLINS. I don't know what the leadership of the CommunistParty was prior to Lawson's coming to Hollywood, because I didn'tcome into the party until about 1938.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was V. J. Jerome's status in the party, as faras you know, from information you obtained then or later ?
Mr. COLLINS. As of that time I understood he was a representativeof the Central Committee of the party.
Mr. TAVENNER. You are speaking now of the national organizationof the Communist Party of the United States ?
Mr. COLLINS. What is now called the National Committee of theAmerican Communist Party.
Mr. TAVENNER. At the time that you took part in the reorganizationof the Screen Writers' Guild, were you a member of the CommunistParty ?
Mr. COLLINS. NO.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you subsequently become a member ?
Mr. COLLINS. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you state to the committee the circumstanceswhich led up to it and the manner in which you became a member?
Mr. COLLINS. I understand that in most cases there was a formaldate of entrance into the Communist Party, but in my case this wasnot so. What happened was that I was asked to come to a meeting,which could have been a class or a meeting of this committee on theguild, and it turned out to be a branch meeting, or whatever it wascalled in those days, of the Communist Party. I think it was calledno objection to being there. As a matter of fact, I think I was quitenot objection to being there. As a matter of fact, I think I was quitesatisfied to be there, and I never questioned it. I was a member byhaving come to that meeting. Subsequently I found out that it wasintended that I be asked, but somehow I never was, but it all workedout all right in the end.
Mr. TAVENNER. Who was instrumental in having you attend thatmeeting?
Mr. COLLINS. It could have been Budd Schulberg. I think he wasstill in the party at that time. Or it might have been Ring Lardner.
Mr. TAVENNER. It might have been Ring Lardner ?
Mr. COLLINS. Ring Lardner, Jr.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were both of those individuals, Budd Schulbergand Ring Lardner, Jr., members of the Communist Party cell to whichyou were assigned?
Mr. COLLINS. That is right.
Mr. TAVENNER. What do you know about the continued CommunistParty activities of Budd Schulberg, if anything?COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE, INDUSTRY223
Mr. COLLINS. It is my understanding he left the party right afterThere was very, veryhis book came out, What Makes Sammy Runsharp criticism of this book in the party and in the party press, andI think he was handled rather ferociously, and he left the party, asI understand, at that time. I haven't seen him for many, many years,but my understanding was that he had quit at that point, wheneverit was, 1939 or 1940, I don't remember exactly, but it was about 6months after What Makes Sammy Run ? came out.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did Ring Lardner, Jr., continue in his CommunistParty relationship for a period of time?
Mr. COLLINS. Yes; I would say up to 1946 or so. After that, I don'tknow what happened to him.
Mr. TAVENNER. You remained in the party until approximatelywhat time ?
Mr. COLLINS. I refused to pay dues at the end of 1947 for the year,and I left for New York in 1948.
Mr. TAVENNER. I don't want to go into the details at this time.
Mr. COLLINS. I see. Just as there was not a formal date of en-trance, there was even a less formal date of exit.
Mr. TAVENNER. Can you give the committee the names of persons,in addition to V. J. Jerome and John Howard Lawson, who were activein the reorganization of the Screen Writers' Guild?
Mr. COLLINS. There were many writers active in the reorganizationof the Screen Writers' Guild.
Mr. TAVENNER. Possibly I didn't make my question clear. I meanthose who were known to you to be members of the Communist Party.
Mr. CoLLINs. At that time there was practically no one known tome to be a member of the Communist Party, because I didn't join theCommunist Party until after the Screen Writers' Guild was reorganized. A great many of those who met in those reorganizationmeetings I never heard of being members of the party. I would haveto discuss that as of a later period.
Mr. TAVENNER. I will defer my questions about members of theCommunist Party until a later period in your testimony. You were amember of the Communist Party for some years. How frequentlydid you attend meetings during the period of your membership ?
Mr. COLLINS. I attended, speaking of all meetings, not only meet-ings of the party, which were maybe once or twice a week, but meetings of whatever organizations I believed to-I attended 4 or 5 a weekfor 3 years, then about 3 a week. I figure it comes to close to 5,000hours. I had about 5,000 hours of meetings, and I think at this pointthat is enough for a lifetime. I don't know that I will have to go toany more.
Mr. TAVENNER. How frequently did you attend strictly CommunistParty meetings ?
Mr. COLLINS. It would depend.It might be once a week; it mightbe twice a week; it.might be only once every 2 weeks. The branchmet every 2 weeks, and I think during the war once every 2 weekswould be it.
Mr. TAVENNER. In the period of your membership, and in the important field in which you were engaged in connection with the Communist Party, I should think you would be in a position to tell thiscommittee what, in your own opinion, was the real purpose of theCommunist Party in organizing itself within Hollywood?224COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY
Mr. COLuxs. Well, of course I can't speak officially about thatsince I was not responsible for the decision to organize it, but I wouldassume that, first, the Communists have a certain respect for culturalworkers, like writers and so on, and therefore being in a field in whichthere were a great many writers, some with some prestige in thecountry, would be one reason.Then I think there was a feeling that the content of films couldbe influenced to some degree, that there might be films on the questionof discrimination against minorities, and so on. These films weremade later, but I think when they were made, Communists had nothingto do with them.Then, also, there was a feeling they could stop or abate to somedegree anti-Communist films. Actually, I don't think this was necessary, because anti-Communist films have had an enormous record ofbeing unsuccessful, like Red Salute, and so on, but there was a feelingthis could be abated to some degree.Then I think also there could have been some feeling that it wasa part of the country in which a certain amount of money could beachieved as far as the party was concerned, on the basis of peoplewho were workers and yet made larger salaries than are madegenerally.But I think that there was a real feeling that the concentration offrustrated or partially frustrated artists or creative people would beuseful in the sense of prestige and many other things, and that thesepeople would make a valuable contribution to whatever aims theCommunist Party had at various times.
Mr. TAVENNER. I would like to ask questions more or less in detailabout each of those reasons which you have assigned as being thepurposes of the Communist Party as far as you were able to judgefrom your experience.You spoke of the use of influence with writers of prestige. Canyou give us' any instances in which the Communist Party did exerciseits influence in the direction of a writer's work ?
Mr. COLLr~s. It is very hard to answer that question, because dur-ing the late thirties and the war period, the whole period, which wasa period of social change, I think that the Communists worked together, and most writers, since it is part of their field to look ahead,were concerned with the future, and that certain questions the Communists used as day-to-day questions, such as the question of racediscrimination, were of concern to writers. And furthermore, thewriters felt they had some contact with the labor movement whichthey would not feel in a small town like Hollywood just writing there.There was a general attitude of interest in social questions, questions such as the Spanish civil war, the anti-Nazi feeling, and thingslike this that writers would normally be concerned with and that theCommunists were also concerned with, so it was not much of a trickfor Communists to be concerned with the things that most writerswere thinking about, and in some cases, I suppose-but this gets intomy own history.The reason that it seemed reasonable to me to become a Communistwas that, being anti-Nazi and for Loyalist Spain, the Communistsseemed to be, both in the United States and in Europe, the most activeopponents of the Nazis and of Franco and Mussolini and Hitler at thattime, and it seemed a perfectly natural gesture to become a Communist.COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY225What we have subsequently learned about both Communists andthe whole international Communist question was certainly not apparent to me in those days, though I admit there were people in thosedays who seemed to know something about it.
Mr. TAVENNER. To be a little more specific, were you acquaintedwith Albert Maltz?
Mr. COLLINS. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you know of the instance in which he was re-quired by Communist Party dictation to change his views and attitude in regard to his method of writing?
Mr. COuLINS. Albert Maltz wrote an article for the New Masses in1945 or 1946, I think it was, in which he made a plea for more freedomfor left-wing and Communist writers.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was Albert Maltz a member of the CommunistParty to your knowledge ?
Mr. COLLINS. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. All right.
Mr. COLLINs. He made a plea for more freedom for left-wing andCommunist writers, and for a more reasonable attitude toward theirwork, and he cited certain examples, as, for example, Watch on theRhine, which I think was attacked at one period and praised at another,and he claimed it must have been a good play at both times; and hemade what seemed to me at the time, and still does, a completelyreasonable plea as far as any creative work.SI know he was attacked chiefly by the Daily Worker and also bycertain members of the national committee of the Communist Party.There was also a meeting of writers in Hollywood-I think there wereseveral but I only attended the first-and at this meeting SamuelSillen came out from New York and led the discussion.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was the name of the person who came fromNew York ?
Mr. COLLINS. Samuel Sillen.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you spell the last name?
Mr. COLINs. S-i-l-l-e-n.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was he a member of the Communist Party?
Mr. COLLINS. I gather he was, although I don't know. He spokeat this meeting, I presume, as a Communist. He led this discussion,which was an attack on Maltz, and certain other people, particularlycertain men who apparently were not too concerned with creativeproblems, were in the forefront of this attack on Maltz as being in-correct, not understanding the class struggle, et cetera.
Mr. TAVENNER. May I interrupt you to read one thing Maltz stated,which I believe was the subject of that controversy, and which I believe may clarify your answer somewhat.
Mr. COLLINS. 0. K.
Mr. TAVENNER. In this article Mr. Maltz stated:I have come to believe that the accepted understanding of art as a weapon isnot a useful guide but a strait-jacket. I have felt this in my own work andviewed it in the works of others. In order to write at all it has long sincebecome necessary for me to repudiate it and abandon it.That is the article you are discussing?
Mr. COLLINS. Yes. That, I presume, came out of Maltz' guts, sinceit was something he had to do to write, as he says. There are men226COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRYwho don't have that problem, and who are not so concerned withwriting as Maltz, and therefore these men find it easy to accept anypolicy. Since' they don't really care about writing, they don t carewhat they are told to do. These were in the forefront in the attackon Maltz.There were several other meetings, but I had had enough, andsubsequently Maltz changed his mind. He wrote another article repudiating what he had first said.
Mr. TAVENNER. I interrupted you at a time when you were speak-ing of the representative from New York who came to address yourgroup. I do not know if you completed your testimony in regard tothat or not.
Mr. COLLNS. I don't remember what he said. I just remember thegeneral feeling, which was that this cry that Maltz had raised forfreedom-well, it gets to the question of what is freedom in writing,and since I have a biased view on it, I don't think I should expresswhat Sillen said.
Mr. TAVENNER. Proceed.
Mr. COLLMUS. Maltz repudiated this first article, and whereas thefirst article came out of his own conviction, the second article obviously came out of a rehash of other people's convictions.That was the end, as far as I know, of the Maltz controversy,although I presume after that there was a good deal of fear on thepart of Communist writers, especially those connected with thingsofficially Communist, of making a mistake such as Maltz had madeMr. TAVENNER. In other words, as a result of Communist Party dictation, he entirely reversed his stated views ?
Mr. COLLINS. Yes. He did it voluntarily.
Mr. TAVENNER. That was one specific instance, was it not, in whichthe Communist Party could and was interested in using a writer ofprestige ?
Mr. COLLINS'. That is right. I guess you could call it that.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you recall an instance in which a writer of ahistory was required to revise his viewpoint with regard to his work?
Mr. CoLLINS. Well, you probably got that out of Maltz' article, inwhich he mentions a friend, or at least a writer he knew, who hadto rewrite a book in order to meet the terms of Communist Partypolicy. This was true, so far as I know, of John Howard Lawsonand his history book.I remember that no sooner would Lawson geta draft done than some new development in Communist Party policywould occur and he would have to rewrite a part of it, or severalchapters of it, in order to make it conform to the new policy.I thinkthis was true in Lawson's case.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you have any more specific information regard-ing that instance ?
Mr. COLLNS. I was present at a meeting with Mr. Lawson and arepresentative of the county at that time, Carl Winter.
Mr. TAVENNER. Who was Carl Winter?
Mr. COLLINS. He was the county organizer in Los Angeles.
Mr. TAVENNER. Of the Communist Party?
Mr. COLLINS. Of the Communist Party. And at that time-therewas a discussionMr. POTTER. Will you bring out the dates ?
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes.What was the date of this instance?COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY
Mr.COLLINS.227It is hard for me to localize it, because I have norecords. I think it was around 1943 or 1944, somewhere around there.This discussion was not like the Maltz controversy, however. Maltzwas really hit over the head. The suggestions to John HowardLawson were suggestions which he was eager to accept.
Mr. TAVENNER. In referring again to this general proposition ofthe purpose and aim of the Communist Party to use writers of prestige,can you say to what extent the Communist Party, in that connection,endeavored to control the organizations to which the writers belonged,or to influence them ?
Mr. COLLINS. The word "influence" is a much better word than"control" in most cases, because I don't think the Communists controlled any organization except maybe the Writers' Mobilization, toward the very end of its life when nobody belonged to it, that is,nobody functioned in it for the Communists.But we always tried to influence any organization to which we belonged, whether there was one Communist in it or a hundred, in that apolicy would be presented which the Commnunists believed of primeimportance.As a rule, in my experience, as in the Screen Writers' Guild no policywas suggested that the membership could not at least consider asreasonable.SThe only time this was done was during the strike period, whenthe painters' union was on strike in 1945 or 1946. The CommunistParty had at one time said that we should go through the picket linesbecause the Communist policy during the war was a no-strike policy,and therefore we went through the picket lines.Then when the war was over and the policy changed, we tried toswing the trend around to supporting the secretaries and the painterswho were out on strike. We were not successful for the simple reasonthe. writers did not understand why they could walk through thepicket lines in February, and not in June. They had a point there,and they wouldn't go along with us.Some would speak of the policy of supporting the strike even thoughthey knew it was unpopular, because they felt 10 years later the members would remember that they had said this and that perhaps theywere right, that time would prove they were right, and therefore theywould win support a decade hence that they didn't have at that time.
Mr. TAVENNER. So that was an instance where the CommunistParty endeavored to control the writers through the Guild?
Mr. COLLINS. Well, the word "control" stops me.
Mr. TAVENNER. Or to influence?
Mr. COLLINS. To influence I think is right; yes.Mi. TAVENNER. Do you recall after 1947 the occasion of an electionwithin the guild when the so-called progressive slate was preparedand again the Communist Party endeavored to influence the action ofthe guild in a particular matter?1r. COLLINS. Around the 1947-the 1947 elections were held in theheat and passion of the former hearing, the hearing in 1947 of thiscommittee, and there was a great deal of feeling on both sides at thattime, and the progressive slate was defeated. And since that time, it isprobably true that no Communists have been on the board of theScreen Writers' Guild.81595-51-pt. 1-12228COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY
Mr. TAVENNER. The progressive slate to which you have referredwas a slate composed of both Communists and non-Communist members?
Mr. COLINs. Yes. The Communists in any policy-or except perhaps very recently-would have the support of a great part or atleast a sizable portion of the membership.
Mr. TAVENNER. And without that support which they were ableto gain, the Communists wouldn't be able to accomplish much, wouldthey?
Mr. COLLINS. Or nothing. That's right.
Mr. TAVENNER. But that slate as supported by the Communistswas defeated ?
Mr. COLLNS. That's right.
Mr. TAVENNER. Now, can you recall any other instances when theCommunist Party used the Screen Writers' Guild for its purposes inendeavoring to influence writers in Hollywood?
Mr. COLLNs. Well, there were two incidents that I remember.Onewas a matter of influence. The other was a matter of-it would haveto be termed something else. The first incident occurred right afterthe Screen Writers' Guild had been reorganized. There were-I don'tknow that there were any Communists on the board of the ScreenWriters' Guild after it was reorganized, but there were at least peoplewho were in favor of advanced policy in the Screen Writers' Guild ora left-wing policy, and it looked very much as if these people wouldbe defeated in the election of 1937, I guess.Now, I think that it's interesting here that the Communist Partyhad done a really fist-rate job of setting up the Screen Writers' Guild,and a very useful job, and must have been quite proud of it.Thispart of the coin looks pretty nice.Now, on the other hand, this incident points out that if you believein the correctness of your cause, you will be willing to do almostanything to win.There was a caucus or a fraction meeting-a fraction is a Communist faction of the general whole; in this case the Screen Writers'Guild whole-and in this caucus we discussed the fact that our opponents had more proxies than we did by far and perhaps wouldswamp us. This looked like a very unfortunate situation.Lester Cole had the notion of suggesting that the old board on whichwe had at least some people who would listen to us should be reelectedby unanimous acclamation. So, at the proper point in the meeting,when it really looked as if Johnny Gray, who was the right-wingtreasurer at that time and who held an enormous number of proxies,with Maury Riskin, where it looked as if they were winning-theywere handing over so many proxies-someone, and I don't rememberwho, got up and said, "Let's reelect the old board who served us sowell in this first year of our trouble by unanimous acclamation."So, I rose to my feet, as did the others. We cheered and applauded.Other people cheered and applauded, and the board was returned byunanimous acclamation.
Mr. TAVENNER. All as a result of the plan and design of the Communist Party members ?
Mr. COLLINS. Yes. At the time I thought it was quite a shrewdnotion.COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE 'INDUSTRY229
Mr. TAVENNER. NOW, you refer to Lester ColeMr. COLLINs. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER (continuing). As being one of the moving parties inthatMr. COLLINS. That's right.
Mr. TAVENNER (continuing). Transaction.Is Lester Cole knownto you to be a member of the Communist Party ?
Mr. COLLINS. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you state who were instrumental and activein endeavoring to impart the Communist Party line to the guild withreference to no strikes during the war period and strikes after thewar period to which you referred in your testimony a little while agowho were members of the Communist Party ?
Mr. COLLINS. Well, I think actually that I have named all of them.There was Lawson-John Howard Lawson, Lester Cole, Ring Lardner, and myself-and I think that in the main we carried on thesestruggles. We also tried to keep the Writers' Mobilization goingtried to get the $10,000 that had been given yearlyMr. TAVENNER. I'll come to that in just a moment.Now, werethere any others you can recall now who were active as CommunistParty members in the effort to impart the Communist Party viewswith regard to strikes?
Mr. COLLINS. Well, I remember particularly the meetings of theboard, you see, and on this, as I remmeber, I was there with JohnHoward Lawson and Ring Lardner and Lester Cole.
Mr. TAVENNER. Now, I want to ask you at the present time to statewhether or not the Communist Party was interested in the organization to which you just referred-the Hollywood Writers' MobilizationMr. COLLINS. Well, yes.SMr. TAVENNER (continuing). And how that occurred.But beforedoing so I believe you should tell us what the Hollywood Writers'Mobilization was and what its purposes were.
Mr. COLLNS. I intended to.The purpose of the Writers' Mobili-zation was to help win the war. Every writer in Hollywood belongedto it. It was an amalgamation of the Screen Writers' Guild, the RadioWriters' Guild, and several other guilds in which either informationcould be gathered or .writing could be done for the war. It was actu-ally its sole purpose during the war years.It turned out an enormous amount of material in terms-for theUSO, the Red Cross, for any war agency, the armed services, and soon-of films, sketches, speeches, radio skits, everything for the war.
Mr. TAVENNER. And during that period of time there was really nomaterial or substantial divergence between the Communist Partyviews in promoting the war effort and those of other persons?
Mr. COLLINS. None. No divergence. The Communists, because theyhad been acquainted, because they had had a more international viewpoint perhaps than some of the other writers, were in a good positionto help in many cases where there were sketches that had to do withour allies, Britain, China-under Chiang Kai-shek at that timeSoviet Russia, the underground movements, and so on.
Mr. TAVENNER. Now, upon the termination-230COMMUNISMIN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY
Mr. WooD. We will take a recess for 30 minutes in order to give themembers of the committee an opportunity to answer this call [Quorumcall on floor of the House]. We will reconvene in 30 minutes.(Thereupon, at 11:10 a. m., the hearing was recessed until 11:55a. m., at which time the following proceedings were had:)
Mr. WooD. The committee will be in order, please.By virtue of the authority vested in me as chairman of this committee, I now set up a subcommittee composed of Messrs. Walter,Doyle, Jackson, and Wood for the purpose of continuing this hearing,and all four of those members are present.You may proceed, Mr. Counsel.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Collins, at the time of taking the recess, I wasasking you about the method used by the Communist Party to controlin certain instances or influence in certain instances writers in Hollywood through the guild, and you were at the beginning'of your testimony regarding the Hollywood Writers' Mobilization. You have already explained the purpose of that organization during the warperiod. Now we have arrived at the termination of the war, so Iwant to ask you whether there was any real purpose or whether thepurpose for which this organization was formed ended with the closeof the war.
Mr. COLLINS. Well, there was a difference of opinion on that. TheScreen Writers' Guild, most of the membership, felt that the purposeof the organization had ended, and the Communist Party felt, I think,that it could be useful in the postwar period.
Mr. TAVENNER. Useful to whom ?
Mr. COLLINS. Well, useful both I suppose to the party and its objectives and in the general-whatever the problems of the postwarperiod were going to be, which at that time I think were not discernible, clearly discernible.The mobilization had been supported by I think $10,000 a year fromthe Screen Writers' Guild, plus money from the Community Chest orthe USO, and also money in smaller amounts from the other unionmembers of the mobilization. A fight developed over the continuation.of this $10,000. As I remember, we-that is, the Communists-be--lieved that the guild should continue to support it. There was a greatdeal of opposition to this. And finally in a membership meeting themembers voted to discontinue the money for the mobilization.
Mr. TAVENNER. About how long did the Hollywood Writers'Mobilization continue ?
Mr. CoLLINs. Well, that's hard-I don't remember exactly, but I'dsay it was about a year or a year and a half after the war.
Mr. TAVENNER. And during that period of time this contest or issuewas being fought out as to whether or not it should be continued ?
Mr. COLLINS. Well, it continued for a while on the grant for thatyear-for instance, in 1945.Then I imagine in 1946 the questioncame up again.(Representative Harold H. Velde entered hearing room.)
Mr. COLLINS (continuing). And at this time I think it lived on a.little bit longer after the $10,000 was withdrawn.
Mr. TAVENNER. Now, why was the Communist Party interested inthe continuation of the Hollywood Writers' Mobilization?
Mr. COLLINS. Well, it had become an excellent vehicle for the pres-entation of material, political material, cultural material, and I think:COMMUNISM INMOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY231they felt it could probably be used for the same purposes in the post-war period. The difference was, of course, that during the war every-one was in complete agreement, and after the war the fissures beganto develop internationally and also, therefore, in the mobilization, inthe guild. So, they couldn't-there was not the unanimity as to whatthe mobilization should do, and a great many writers obviously werejust as happy to forget about it. They felt that it had finished itspurpose, and they didn't want to do anything with it.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, was there any project which the CommunistParty was particularly interested in which might be projected or putinto effect through the Hollywood Writers' Mobilization
Mr. COLLINS. Well, the Communists were interested in any projectthat was originated in the mobilization. I don't remember all thoseprojects. I think many of them never came to fruition. I remembera great deal of discussion at the time about what the mobilizationshould do, what its program should be for the future, and so on,butMr. TAVENNER. Discusion among whom ?
Mr. COLLINS. Well, I remember discussions with Jack Lawson onthis.
Mr. TAVENNER. IS Jack Lawson the same person as John HowardLawson?
Mr. COLLINS. Yes, John Howard Lawson. But the content of thesediscussions and what was arrived at I don't really recall.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, what were some projects?
Mr. COLLINS Well, there was a project that I remember very vaguely,called Counterattack, which I think was an anticensorship, antiwell, I don't-I remember it but there again I don't remember thecontent.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was that aimed in part at this committee, theCommittee on Un-American Activities ?
Mr. COLLINS. Well, I think it predated this committee.It wasaimed at the-I suppose in a general sense, yes, it was aimed at this,the kind of activity that the committee represents, that this committeerepresents.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, was that project a project that the CommunistParty was interested in ?
Mr. COLLINS. Of course they were interested in it; yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. And was the Communist Party responsible for theprojecting of that idea into the organization of Hollywood Writers'Mobilization ?
Mr. COLuNS. Yes; I guess it was.
Mr. TAVENNER. Now, can you recall any other?
Mr. COLLINs. Well, there was a subcommittee I think or a committee which met with some of the physicists from California Techfor the purpose of acquainting the public with the nature of atomicenergy and, you know, what the dangers were in the atomic bomb andwhat kind of weapon it was, and so on.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, was there set. up within the HollywoodWriters' Mobilization what was known as the Atomic Energy Commission?
Mr. COLLINs. That might have been the name of it. There wassuch a committee set up. It was to acquaint the-you see, the mobili-232COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRYzation had carried on various meetings all during the war with manypeople. For instance, a physician came from Birmingham Hospital,gave a seminar on the problems of the men at Birmingham.Andthere were seminars on many, many subjects in which people wouldcome from the outside and discuss them during the war, especiallyrelating to any war activity.So, therefore, this seminar which was supposed to be set up onatomic energy was in line with these previous seminars which hadbeen discussed, and there was such a committee set up with somescientists from California Tech.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was the Communist Party interested in that par-ticular project?
Mr. COLLINS. Well, insofar as the Communist Party was interestedin the mobilization, it was interested in this project.
Mr. TAVENNER. What use did the Communist Party plan to makeof this particular group ? In what way did it expect to put this particular group to work or influence it to work?
Mr. COLLINS. Well, I think that the Communist Party was honestlyconcerned with the question of peace, and since the Communist Partymembers honestly believed that the danger to peace comes from theUnited States and since the atom bomb was the United States weaponprimarily-certainly at that time-they felt that since the scientistswere also concerned with the terrible nature of the atom bomb thatthere could be a natural union between the concern of the scientistsover the terror of the bomb, of its nature, of its misuse perhaps, andthe fear of the Communists of war at that time.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, in what way did the Communists plan tomake use of that union of effort between scientists and the HollywoodWriters' Mobilization
Mr. COLLINS. Well, the scientists had the knowledge concerning theterror of the bomb, and they had the fear of it. But they didn't havethe know-how as far as getting it out to the public was concerned.And the Writers' Mobilization did have that know-how. So, therefore,it seemed like a natural union between the concerned scientists andthe experienced, in this case, publicists.
Mr. TAVENNER. Then, was it the interest and purpose of the Com-munist Party to disseminate that information as fear information tothe American public?
Mr. COLLINS. Yes, I think that's right. It was the normal conclu-sion you could draw-that the scientists were fearful and could probably make, since they knew a lot about it-I think they still are fearful-could probably make other people fearful if they could get tothem, and the mobilization would get to them.
Mr.TAVENNER.And it was a part of the Communist Party plan todisseminate that information to the public ?
Mr. COLuINs. Well, here again Iwas not responsible for formu-lating the Communist Party plans in the sense that they were formulated undoubtedly, if they were, from another source, but as far asI understood it I guess that's a reasonable presumption that theywere interested in- a certain amount of fear on the part of the peopleand that they thought this was a reasonable project. And at thattime it's true I think, in the main, Communists were the center of themobilization after the war.COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE. INDUSTRY233
Mr. TAVENNER. You made reference to the holding of seminars.Were seminars held on the subject of atomic energy ?
Mr. COLLINS. Yes, there was one. There may have been others butI only remember one of them.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did various scientists address the meeting?
Mr. COLLINS. Yes. It was a broad meeting. I think that peoplewere invited as well as the mobilization people. Anyone could comeand probably did. And I remember Coinog, who was one of thescientists whose name stuck in my head.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you recall the full name?
Mr. COLLINS. No. But, at any rate, he spoke as a physicist, andhe made particular care to mention when he would come to a certainpoint that it was impossible to pursue it further because it was restricted. I had the feeling the scientists were very careful and veryconscientious men.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you know whether the commission-first, ofall, were you a member of that commission ?
Mr. COLLINS. I think so.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you know whether the commission endeavoredto assemble scientific information from the scientific departments ofvarious universitiesMr. COLLINS. Not to my knowledge.
Mr. TAVENNER (continuing). And other places ?
Mr. COLLINS. Not to my knowledge; no. No, I don't think-I doubtthat. I mean my feeling is that the most of the people who wereinvolved in it would not really believe that they could get anythingvery useful in terms of information about atom science from a casualacquaintance with a few scientists who came over with some concern.There was a time at which the Federation of Atomic Scientists hadbeen set up and were publishing a magazine and were really concerned with getting their problem to the public, and so the idea theycould perhaps get writers to help them with speeches or perhaps makea film or something like that was of great interest to the scientists.But I really don't believe that anyone of my acquaintance was naiveenough to believe that these scientists would divulge anything, thatas writers we could influence them on the basis of meeting with themtwo or three times.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, aside from the question of influencing thescientists in any manner, did they assemble, to your knowledge, anyscientific information relating to the atomic bomb ?
Mr. COLLINs. Well, they might have, but it would have been likethe Smyth report or whatever it's called. You know. That wasfairly-that anyone could pick up. I doubt if they went beyondthat, althought I don't even remember that. I suppose if a manwanted to find out something about it he would have read what wasavailable. But the real thing is, as far as we were concerned in termsof our program, we didn't really have to know much about atomicenergy in terms of, you know, how a bomb is made. All we had to dowas to pursue the policy that the atom bomb was a dangerous weapon,which you can certainly write about without having any inside information as to how a bomb is made. All you have to know about isHiroshima and so on, and you can do a pretty good job.234COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you know what disposition was made of anymaterial or information that was obtained as a result of the seminarsor as a result of scientific persons furnishing information to the group ?
Mr. COLLINS. No. We were going to write a series of radio pro-grams dealing with atomic energy on a kind of creative literary basis.But, as I say, those programs, as I remember them-I don't remembera couple of them-didn't really deal with any scientific aspects ofatomic energy.
Mr. TAVENNER. They just dealt with the terror aspect of the bomb?
Mr. COLLINS. Well, I remember one of them was about-one of themdealt with a man who has the bomb in a suitcase, similar to this Britishfilm.I suppose you could call that terror, which it was.And oneof them dealt with-it was called "Happy Birthday, Dear EarthStar," which was about some people on another planet who have gonethrough this before and who watch the earth join-you know-theother stars.
Mr. TAVENNER. As a result of the atomic bomb explosion?
Mr. COLLINS. As a result of atomic energy; that's right.So, you see, in order to do this you need perhaps some creativityand imagination, but you don't really need much information aboutthe atom bomb.Now, I never knew of any assemblage of material. I mean I can'tsay the fact there wasn't any, because I don't know, you know. But itcertainly was outside of my purview.
Mr. TAVENNER. Earlier in your testimony you stated that anotherreason why the Communist Party was interested in organizing communism within Hollywood was the possibility of influencing films.Now, as a practical matter, was that possible of accomplishment?
Mr. COLLINS. Well, not to any-no. It was possible of accomplish-ment only in terms of the whole tendency of the country, so I think,as I said before, if the proper presentation, let's say, of a Negro on thescreen has been accomplished since then and not by Communists, butcertainly Communists who would have been handed a Negro character would have tried to give him a certain dignity let's say. In thissense they would have affected the content of films.But, since the basic policy isn't in the hands of the writer or thedirector but in the hands of the owners of the studio, who are not at allinterested in this propaganda, the chances of any real presentation ofCommunist material or what is termed Communist material in termsof Communist Party or foreign policy are I think extremely unlikely.(Representative Bernard W. Kearney entered hearing room.)
Mr. COLLINS (continuing). Now, at one time I think that Communistwriters felt that the inclusion of several progressive lines might bea happy thing, but finally it was realized that this didn't mean any-thing to anybody unless you had the code book with you that told youwhat those lines mearit, so this policy was dropped and was consideredno longer reasonable.I think I discussed the fact that there would be an attempt madenot to have anti-Communist or anti-Soviet films made in this earlyperiod. I'm not talking about now, because I don't know anythingwasabout the present time. I remember one example of, I think -itLester Cole wrote a film about a boys' school, and at that time therewas a statement of Dolores Ibarruri, who was called "La Passionara"in Spain. She had said a famousCOMMUNISM INMOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY235
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you spell the title, please?
Mr. COLLINS. "La Passionara"? I don't know. I would rather notattempt it.
Mr. TAVENNER. All right.
Mr. COLLINS. At any rate, she had said, and it was a famous sloganduring the Spanish Civil War, "I would rather die on my feet thanlive on my knees." And Cole I think in some speech of one of thecoaches in the school had him give this line. Now, I felt, and I thinkmost people did, that this wasn't-that you could scarcely call thispropaganda. I mean it was just I think he was perhaps pleased withthe line, but it really didn't mean anything.I think a better example of the difficulty--of the way in whicha picture is handled is Song of Russia about which there has beena great deal of discussion. Do you want me to discuss that?
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you have any connection with the Song ofRussia ?
Mr. COLLINS. Yes. Paul Jarrico and I wrote it or did the screenplay on it, that is.
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes; we would like to hear the incident.
Mr. COLLINS. Well----
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you spell the name "Jarrico" ?
Mr. COLLINS. J-a-r-r-i-c-o. We had this picture, Thousands Oheer,for M-G-M, and M-G-M had bought a story about Russia called"Scorched Earth," and the same producer was making this Scorched.Earth film as had made Thousands Cheer. They were both musicals.And we got the assignment on Song of Russia, wrote a first draft ofit, corrected the first draft on the basis of-as any first draft is corrected, on the basis of what could be helped in it from a writingstandpoint. And then the script with which apparently the studiowas pleased was sent to David Selznick so he could borrow-so Metrocould borrow Ingrid Bergman.Selznick objected to the script on the basis it was too favorable toSoviet Russia, and there was a conference held with Mr. Mayer, Mr.Mankiewicz and Mr. Katz, Gregory Ratoff who was the director-Mr. TAVENNER. Now, will you begin the list of those names overagain?
Mr. COLLINS. Yes. Louis B. Mayer and Joseph Mankiewicz.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you spell the last name?
Mr. COLLINS. NO. You can find that. Sam Katz. And GregoryRatoff. The producer, Joe Pasternak. Mr. Jarrico and myself.
Mr. TAVENNER. About when was this ?
Mr. COLLINS. 1942. Somewhere around there. 1943. I don'tknow exactly. At any rate, Mr. Mayer said-I'm not quoting himdirectly-he didn't understand what the problem was, that he certainly didn't want-that he wanted to make a picture about Russiabecause Russia was in the news, that they had made pictures aboutEngland, France, and so on, and that it seemed reasonable to make apicture about Russia, but, on the other hand, he didn't want to makeany Communists-and that if the picture couldn't be made-so if itwas going to make trouble he'd just as soon not make it.I think, as I remember, that the picture was saved by Joe Mankiewicz who said there was no reason why it couldn't be made andcmade without any trouble. I think that was the complete feeling at236COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRYthe time, because actually in 1943 what Song of Russia said aboutRussia was far less glowing than what Winston Churchill was sayingor Douglas MacArthur or President Roosevelt or General Eisenhoweror anybody else. I mean this was the period in which Russia was agreat country.So that the picture actually in those terms was pretty lukewarmcompared to the statements, to the feeling of the time. However, itwas decided that there were certain things such as the collective farmsthat should be omitted. Now, of course, this is really kind of a ticklishpoint, because if you show the farmers on collective farms you're introuble, but, on the other hand, if you show that they own individualfarms of this nature then you're in trouble, too.So we decided, forbetter or worse, not to mention what kind of farms these were. Andthen we took out words like "community" and did a general job ofcleaning it up on this level.We did, in short, what we were instructed to do on the film, and noone suspected when it came out-it seemed rather innocuous-that itwould ever-you know, that 5 years later anyone would ever remember it.But, nevertheless, there was a complete discussion as far as itscontent was concerned, and it was felt that in view of the times therewas-the basic part of the picture was that this Russian girl whorepresented the Russian people was patriotic and believed in hercountry and was set against the Nazis, and that she and the Americanhad the common purpose which was to defeat the Nazis and do thebest they could each for their own land, which at the time was anextremely reasonable position and was pleased, as I say, by everyonepresent.I doubt if any picture could be made without the front officeO. K.'ing it, and this would mean that it would be-especially nowadays but I think certainly even then-viewed pretty carefully.A great many things that seem in retrospect to be left wing werereally part and parcel of the times, and this was certainly one of them.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you identify Paul Jarrico more definitely forus?How long had you known him?
Mr. COLLINS. About 5 years.
Mr. TAVENNER. How closely had he been associated with you inyour work during that period of 5 years ?
Mr. CoIrs. Well, we first started working together I think in1940, and we sold a story to M-G-M and then one to Universal.
Mr. TAVENNER. HOW many screen plays did he work on with you ?
Mr. COLLINS. Three.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was he a member of the Communist Party?
Mr. COLLINs. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was the writing of this screenplay influenced bythe membership of yourself and Jarrico in the Communist Party ?
Mr. COLLINS. Well, I suppose it could have been to some degree, inthat we probably knew more about the country than one would knowif you had never read anything about it or looked at anything about it.We had seen Soviet films and read material about the Soviet Union,and I imagine we had a certain amount of knowledge about it.Nothing first-hand, but at least second- or third-hand. But in termsof what we said in the picture I doubt if it had anything to do withCOMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY237our being Communists except that we were pleased with it. We werepleased with the assignment.But at that time we were-as I said.before--we would have beenpleased with a picture on the resistance movement in Europe; Wewould have been pleased with anything of that nature that we feltwould help the war. And we certainly felt that this picture would.And also we believed, as I think many, many millions of peoplehoped, that the relations between the United States and Russia wouldbe friendly and that this couldn't hurt it.
Mr. TAVENNER. Now, the individuals you have mentioned as repre-senting the moving-picture industry who took part in those discussions, will you state what positions they had in industry ?
Mr. COLLINS. Well, Mr. Mayer was theMr. TAVENNER. And whether or not any of them were members ofthe Communist Party to your knowledge.
Mr. COLLINS. Well, Mr. Mayer to my knowledge is not a memberof the Communist Party, and he was the boss of the studio. SamKatz was the executive in charge of a number of producers, of whichPasternak was one. I would say that he in my knowledge was not amember of the Communist Party. And Mr. Joe Mankiewicz was, Isuppose, one of the brightest boys at the studio, and he was not amember of the party. And Gregory Ratoff is a White Russian, as Iunderstand it, and consequently I would presume he would not be amember of the party. So that outside of Mr. Jarrico and myself, Iwould say that there were no other Communists present at this meeting.
Mr. TAVENNER. Now, were there instances that came to your attention when the Communist Party was interested around the other way,interested in checking the production of plays which it considered tobe anti-Communist?
Mr. COLLINS. Well, no; I don't know of anything like that in myexperience.The only picture that we were concerned with in check-ing my memory was I think a picture called Tennessee Johnson.Wasn't that the name of it? I don't know Tennessee Johnson-it hada very biased, from our point of view, picture of Thaddeus Stevens.(Representative John S. Wood left the hearing room.)
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, was protest made by the Communist Party tothe production of the picture, in which I believe you were probablyone of'the protesters ?
Mr. COLLINS. I think that the Communist Party nationally mayhave done something about it as far as the press was concerned, andI think that we tried to persuade the studio that this picture was adistortion of history; yes, but that's the only instance I know of. Itwasn't very effective, either. I think the picture was made preciselyas written.
Mr. TAVENNER. Now, in order to influence by propaganda anyscreenplay, you would have to be-successful in putting the plan overon not one but more than one responsible representative of the industry, wouldn't you ?
Mr. COLLINS. That's right.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, about how many representatives of industrywould be involved in passing upon a screen play which was written?238COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY
Mr. COLuNs. Well, you would have to pass firstly your own producer, and then the chances are the director would have to go alongwith it, and then the front office, and at different studios the frontoffices are set up differently. Now, at M-G-M in those days it reallyhad to go through four or five people. Some studios might be runon a more singlehanded basis, as, for instance, Twentieth-CenturyFox. I imagine if you could get it past Mr. Zanuck you would be inbusiness.But also then you have to get some actor, the star, who is very important, who will also have to say 0. K. Now, Bob Taylor as it was, Ithink, objected to Song of Russia and to line in it, and so on, and, asI remember, they had to be in some cases changed so that you wouldhave to get by a great number of people in order to make the picture.But the point is, you see, that after all the Communists don't try toget in-what is called Communist propagana-I don't think Communists would try to get in, because they would know beforehandthat it wasn't successful. If a Communist, as I say, writes a Negrowith some dignity, the chances are he will get that, you know-in themain, that might get through, because no one would see, would feelthat that was necessarily Communist propaganda. If he writes a picture about the resistance movement, let's say, during the war, in whichsomebody in the resistance movement is a hero, and there were suchfilms, no one would object to that, because they wouldn't feel that itwas necessarily any more Communist than their own position.So that in terms of-you know perfectly well that if all the Communists got together now and wrote a pro-Soviet film it wouldn't be made.So I doubt if Communists are spending much time working on thiskind of project. I mean they have a certain amount of reality asregards this. You can only do what's possible within the frameworkof the period and what other people feel, andMr. TAVENNER. Now, you have stated that another purpose of theCommunist Party in organizing communism in Hollywood was fromthe financial viewpoint. What did you mean when you referred tothat?
Mr. COLLNS. Well, I think that just in terms of dues or assessments rather that there was at one time during the war period whenthere were I think more Communists than at any other time-I meanas far as this section was concerned-a fair amount of money receivedfrom these people. I don't remember. I think the assessment whenI was last in the party was about 4 percent.
Mr. TAVENNER. Four percent of what?
Mr. COLLINs. Of your salary after the agent's deduction. Youdeduct the agent's commission and then you take 4 percent of that.That is as I remember it.
Mr. VELDE. What agent?
Mr. COLLINS. The professional agent's commission. Four percentprobably amounted to in those days quite a good deal of money.Then also I think in terms of certain other things, certain otherspecific projects, that people would contribute money, and since therewas money in this community, and that in that sense it was useful.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you state to the committee what was the extentof your contributions to the Communist Party while you were a member of the party-say monthly or weekly ?COMMUNISMiN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY239
Mr. COLLINS. Well, I don't know exactly what it was. The assessments, I think I probably paid them up to, except toward the end,pretty regularly. I don't know.I suppose that during the periodI was at Metro, which was the war years, it was around $185 a month,something like that.
Mr. TAVENNER. You paid $185 a month?
Mr. COLLINS. Well, around that.
Mr. TAVENNER. Over how long a period of time was that ?
Mr. COLLINS. Well, I don't know. Three or four years 1 guess.Maybe more.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did other persons who were members of the Com-munist Party to your knowledge pay on a like proportion with you'.
Mr. COLLINS. Oh, yes. That was understood.
Mr. TAVENNER. Now, those payments which you made, were they theordinary dues that you were expected to pay, or did youMr. COLLINS. No, no. The dues, I don't remember what they werebut they were nominal. This was an asessment above your dues basedon the fact that-on the idea that-since you made a higher salarythan the average party member in the country you could afford to paymore money. So this assessment was in addition to the dues, which,as I say, were nominal, whatever they were.
Mr. TAVENNER. TO whom were those dues paid? How were theypaid ?
Mr. COLLINS. Well, they were paid to the financial secretary of thebranch.
Mr. TAVENNER. Of the branch of which you were a member ?
Mr. COLLINS. Yes. It's on the honor system in a sense because norecords are kept. You'd pay what you believed you owed.
Mr. TAVENNER. But the financial secretary would have an idea ofhow much you owed ?
Mr. COLLINS. Yes; they certainly would. He or she would.
Mr. TAVENNER. Who was the financial secretary to whom you madepayments ?
Mr. COLLINS. Well, I don't remember any time except at the verybeginning when I was the financial secretary, the first group. Theonly one I remember, I don't know. I don't really remember whoused to get the money, because, you see, the group didn't remain constant. There were probably in my time quite a few groups. And thisis a job that nobody particularly wanted, so thatMr. TAVENNER. Well, when you were a financial secretary, whenyou first entered the party, what disposition did you make of the fundswhich you received as the financial secretary ?
Mr. COLLINS. I turned them over to Madelaine Ruthven.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you spell the last name?
Mr. COLLINS. R-u-t-h-v-e-n.
Mr. TAVENNER. Ruthven?
Mr. COLLINS Right.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was her official position?
Mr. COLLINS. She was the organizational secretary I think.
Mr. TAVENNER. I have asked several witnesses, including V. J.Jerome, who appeared before this committee a few weeks ago, whetheror not it was true that the national organization of the CommunistParty refused to permit these dues to be paid or these assessments240COMMUNISM INMOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRYto be paid to the Communist Party of the State of California andfrom a certain date directed that those payments be made directly tothe national organization of the Communist Party of the UnitedStates in New York due to the fact that it was such a tremendouslylarge figure into which these assessments ran. Is that correct or nott
Mr.COLLINS.Well, I don't know much about that. I rememberthat the-I never had much to do with it, but I remember that therewas a split between the national office, the State, county, and the section itself, in which I think the national office got the greatest amount..But what the split was or precisely what it was I wouldn't know, because it really wasn't in my field.
Mr. VELDE. The greatest amount of what?Dues?Or your spe-cial assessments?
Mr. COLLINS. Oh, no. The special assessments.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did the special asessments go directly to the na-tional office?
Mr. COLLINS. Well, I don't think in toto. I think that the sectionin Hollywood broke off, you know, what was supposed to be the percentage that was supposed to be sent and sent the largest sum directly,as I said, to the national office. But here-I didn't send it. I thinkyou know, this isn't really-this is my understanding, but I certainlywouldn't be held to it, because I never .hadreally anything to do with it.
Mr. TAVENNER. The payments were not made directly to the na--tional office, but throughMr. COLLINS. Through this section.
Mr. TAVENNER. Through the section official who had charge of the-particular matter?
Mr. COLLINS. Uh huh. That's right.
Mr. TAVENNER. I failed to ask you a little while ago, in speaking-of the Hollywood Writers' Mobilization, who was the organizer ofit or its first president. Let us put it that way.
Mr. COLLINS. Bob Rossen was the first president.
Mr. TAVENNER. Bob who?
Mr. COLLINS. He was the first chairman. Robert Rossen.
Mr. TAVENNER. Robert Rossen? R-o-s-s-e-n?
Mr. COLLINS. Yes. I don't know who organized it.I don't know-it was necessary to organize it in the sense that it was a normal wartime set-up.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you know whether or not he was a member ofthe Communist Party ?
Mr. COLLINS. He was.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you know how he is employed now?
Mr. COLLINS. Well, I think he is a producer at Columbia.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you know where he is ?
Mr. COLLINS. No. I talked to him about a picture about 2 monthsago. He was in Hollywood for a while. I think he had been in Europeand then he had been in Mexico making The Brave Bulls. He toldme in 1947 that he had sent a note to Harry Cohn-I guess it was1948-that he had sent a letter to Harry Cohn saying he was not a.Communist, by which I presume that he has disaffiliated himself.
Mr. TAVENNER. TO Harry-?
Mr. COLLINS. Harry Cohn.
Mr. TAVENNER. K-o-h-n or C-o-h-n?
Mr. COLLINS. C-o-h-n.COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY241
Mr. TAVENNER. C-o-h-n?
Mr. COLLINS. Who was the president, I think, of Columbia Pic-tures. I gather he's disaffiliated himself, but that is as much as Iknow. At the time, at any rate, he was in the party, and he was thechairman.
Mr. TAVENNER. How do you know he was a member of the Communist Party?
Mr. COLLINS. Well, I had meetings with him. I had a meeting athis house-well, one or several at his house.
Mr. TAVENNER. Can you give the committee any idea of the num-ber of Communist Party meetings that you attended at which RobertRossen was present?
Mr. COLLINS. Well, in order to say that a man was a Communist Iwould have to remember out of my 5,000 hours precisely what themeeting was about, that it was a Communist meetings, what room itwas held in, and who was present, you know, so that I would remember specific-I could only-I can't remember how many. I remembersitting in his house, that it was a Communist meeting, and that Rossenwas present.Unless I can remember the place, the nature of the meeting-because, after all, these 5,000 hours were mainly not Communist meetings-I just don't see that it's possible for me to say that he was a Communist, because you know I may have some feeling about it but I don'tthink that that warrants this kind of label. So that I remember, how-.ever, specifically in this case seeing him.
Mr. TAVENNER. In this case you do remember specifically ?
Mr. COLLINS. That's right.
Mr. TAVENNER. Who was the secretary of the Hollywood WritersMobilization when it was first formed ?
Mr. COLmIN. The executive secretary was Pauline Lauber.
Mr. TAVENNER. L-a-u-b-e-r. Is that the spelling?
Mr. COLLINS. That's right.
Mr. TAVENNER. IS she also known by the name of Pauline LauberFinn?
Mr. CorLINS. Yes; I think so.
Mr. TAVENNER. F-i-n-n?(Mr. Collins nodding affirmatively.),
Mr. TAVENNER. Was she a member of the Communist Party ?
Mr. COLLINS. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you recall discussing among members of theCommunist Party any arrearage in dues of Robert Rossen ?
Mr. COLLNS. Oh, I think he was in arrears; yes, sir.
Mr. TAVENNER. You think he was in arrears?
Mr. COLINs. Yes; I think so.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you remember the extent to which Robert Rossenwas in arrears in the payment of his assessments ?
Mr. COLLINS. It was a considerable amount of money, but I couldn'ttell exactly. It was a handy sum.
Mr. VELDE. Could you put any limits on that in dollars and cents ?
Mr. COLLINS. Oh, it was in the lower registers of four figures Iwould say. One of the tests of being a good Communist was to payyour dues so that there must have been some criticism of Rossen.242COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY
Mr. TAVENNER. Can you name other persons who were connectedwith the Hollywood Writers' Mobilization who were known to you tobe members of the Communist Party?
Mr. COLLINS. Well, John Howard Lawson was one of the primemovers. I don't offhand-No, I don't remember anybody else.
Mr. KEARNEY. IS he doing any writing in Hollywood at the presenttime?
Mr. COLLINS. I doubt that very much.
Mr. KEARNEY. Are any of the 10 convicted Hollywood writers doingany writing at the present time that you know of?
Mr. COLLINS. Well, no. I think these men were just recently re-leased, just in this past week, from jail, and, you know, I doubt thatthey are doing any writing in Hollywood.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was there any other plan for raising funds by theCommunist Party used in Hollywood to your knowledge besides thepayment of dues and special assessments ?
Mr. COLLINS. I think that people were asked, who might have beensympathetic but not so sympathetic that they were party members.They might have been asked for contributions. I have heard of suchthings, although I don't know from my own experience.(Representative Donald L. Jackson left hearing room.)
Mr. COLLINS (continuing). I don't know from my own experience,but I heard that people were asked if they would contribute moneyeven if they were not in, and I imagine that in the resistance movementdays that people would have contributed money who were really notparticularly sympathetic with the aims of communism at all but whoadmired the struggle that the Communists were making in the resistance movement against Nazi Germany.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were benefits held to which actors and writers wereinvited ?
Mr. COLLINS. Yes, but these were not Communist Party benefits. Imean they might have been benefits for Loyalist Spain or benefits forany cause which a great many people supported.
Mr. TAVENNER. Now, let us go back for a few moments to your firstmembership in the Communist Party. I believe you stated that in1938Mr. COLLINS. That's right.
Mr. TAVENNER (continuing). You united with the party.
Mr. COLLINS. That's right.
Mr. TAVENNER. Now, were you assigned to a cell, a particular cell?
Mr. COLLINS. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you describe to the committee the organiza-tional set-up as you found it to be ?
Mr. COLLINS. Well, a group has a chairman and a literature directorwho's responsible for selling the innumerable pamphlets, books, andso on, on the subject and is supposed to give some little resume of whatthe most recent material is and to sell it; the membership director,whose job is not only what kind of work the membership is doing inthe party or in organizations, various outside organizations, but alsohe's mainly concerned with recruiting, with the organizer of thebranch or the chairman of the branch.And then the dues. The financial director. This would be calledthe executive of the branch. They would prepare an agenda for theCOMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY243meeting which would take up perhaps some general political educationand in some cases a specific question which might have to do with thework, the mass organization work, of one or more of the members.(Representative John S. Wood returned to hearing room.)
Mr. COLLINs (continuing). These meetings are, as a rule, fairly longand not terribly interesting. And they, you know, are very mild interms of content. They would discuss day-to-day questions, you know,whatever those happened to be, the political questions of the day.Now, for instance, I imagine that today, like everybody else inAmerica, a Communist branch would be discussing the Truman-MacArthur dispute. This would be the topic of discussion or one of thetopics of discussion. It might not be discussed precisely from theperspective of the rest of the country, but it would be discussed.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you mean by that it would be discussed fromthe standpoint of the interest of the Communist PartyMr. COLLINS. And of the Soviet Union.
Mr. TAVENNER (continuing). And of the Soviet Union ?(Mr. Collins nodding affirmatively.)
Mr. TAVENNER. At the meetings did you also discuss the ways andmeans of carrying into effect the influence which you desired to beexerted upon the various groups that you were members of, such asthe Writers' Guild ?
Mr. COLLINS. No.The chances are this wouldn't be discussed in abranch meeting; that this would only be discussed in the prewar yearsin a fraction meeting, and in the war years, if at all, in a progressivecaucus-that is, a group of Communists and many non-Communists.During the war years, during the so-called Browder period, theCommunists tried not to have separate meetings. They-I mean ofa mass organization. They tried to do away with the fractions onthe theory that there were no interests of the mass organization thatwere in any way different from the Communists' and, therefore, anything that could be discussed in a Communist meeting could be discussed outside of it.With the end of the Browder period, I think this changed, and whatis going on now I wouldn't know.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you tell the committee who were members ofthis first group to which you were assigned as far as you can recall?
Mr. COLLINS. Well, I have named almost all the members of thisgroup so far. There was Ring Lardner, Budd Schulberg, and PaulJarrico. This was the basis of the group. There were other people,but I don't know that I ever saw them subsequently, and consequentlyI don't'really remember them.
Mr. TAVENNER. How many of those persons did you collect duesand assessments from ?
Mr. COLLINS. Oh, I guess all of them, but at that time the assess-ments amounted to quite-didn't amount to a great deal of money.We were all young writers and all beginning, and it was a very smallamount of money, as I remember, a month. About a hundred dollars,I think; a little over or a little under.
Mr. TAVENNER. How long did you remain in that particular groupor cell ?(Representative Francis E. Walter left the hearing room.)81595-51-pt. 1---13244COMMUNISMINMOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY
Mr. COLLINS. Well, I find that hard to answer, because I don'tremember, because it could have been a year and a half or a year,somewhere around in there.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you then transferred or assigned to some othergroup ?
Mr. COLLINs. Yes, I was.
Mr. TAVENNER. Tell the committee about that.
Mr. COLLINS. It was another group, and some of the same peoplecame along, and I can't remember much about it. It met at the houseof a man called Martin Berkeley who was a screen writer at the timeand who I think subsequently left.
Mr. TAVENNER. Martin Berkeley?
Mr. COLLINS. Yes. B-e-r-k-e-1-e-y. And I remember from thatgroup only Sam Ornitz, Samuel Ornitz, O-r-n-i-t-z.
Mr. TAVENNER. Samuel Ornitz was one of the 10 who appeared be-fore this committee in 1947 ?
Mr. COLLINS. That's right.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you assigned to any other branches or unitsof the Communist Party?
Mr. COLLINS. Well, yes, I must have been assigned to several subsequently, but I don't really remember the dates or I mean the-Youknow, it's not only a great many years ago but a great many othermeetings were going on, and I don't'remember the precise dates orwhat the groups were.There was a group I belonged to somewhere in there, and I remembera couple of fresh faces, but that's about all.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, what were the names of the new faces ?
Mr. COLLIN.Well, a man called Herbert Blach6 and his wife,B-l-a-c-h-g. I think he had been a silent movie actor.And a woman called Nora Hallgren.
Mr. TAVENNER. Could you spell the last name?I don't know.
Mr. COLLIuN. H-a-l-l-g-r-e-n. And I understood she had onceworked for Lenin or been his secretary or something.
Mr. TAVENNER. In Russia?
Mr. COLLINs. Yes.(Representative Francis E. Walter returned to hearing room.)
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you know how she is presently employed ?
Mr. COLLINS. No, I don't.
Mr. TAVENNER. How was she employed at that time ?
Mr. COLLINS. I don't know that she was. I think that her husbandworked somewhere, but he wasn't-I don't recall him as in the group.,See, after all, the Communist Party, for reasons that are now evident,was not anxious to have everybody know who everybody else was,and there was, in the efforts of security, a certain amount of holdingthe same people together, especially when the work-as for instance,my work-was in specific mass organizations. I mean in the ScreenWriters' Guild, in the mobilization. So, therefore, I would knowonly except by hearsay the Communists in those particular organizations.
Mr. TAVENNER. Now, I have been asking you about the names ofvarious Communists here. I understand your reply is that in eachinstance you know of your own personal knowledge that, they weremembers of the Communist Party and you're not relying upon hearsaytestimony.244COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY
Mr. COLrLNS. Well, I find that hard to answer, because I don'tremember, because it could have been a year and a half or a year,somewhere around in there.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you then transferred or assigned to some othergroup?
Mr. COLLINS. Yes, I was.
Mr. TAVENNER. Tell the committee about that.
Mr. COLLINS. It was another group, and some of the same peoplecame along, and I can't remember much about it. It met at the houseof a man called Martin Berkeley who was a screen writer at the timeand who I think subsequently left.
Mr. TAVENNER. Martin Berkeley?
Mr. COLLINS. Yes. B-e-r-k-e-l-e-y. And I remember from thatgroup only Sam Ornitz, Samuel Ornitz, O-r-n-i-t-z.
Mr. TAVENNER. Samuel Ornitz was one of the 10 who appeared before this committee in 1947 ?
Mr. COLLINS. That's right.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you assigned to any other branches or unitsof the Communist Party ?
Mr. COLLINS. Well, yes, I must have been assigned to several subsequently, but I don't really remember the dates or I mean the-Youknow, it's not only a great many years ago but a great many othermeetings were going on, and I don't-remember the precise dates orwhat the groups were.There was a group I belonged to somewhere in there, and I remembera couple of fresh faces, but that's about all.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, what were the names of the new faces?
Mr. COLLINS. Well, a man called Herbert Blach6 and his wife,B-l-a-c-h-e. I think he had been a silent movie actor. I don't know.And a woman called Nora Hallgren.
Mr. TAVENNER. Could you spell the last name ?
Mr. COLuiNs. H-a-l-l-g-r-e-n. And I understood she had onceworked for Lenin or been his secretary or something.
Mr. TAVENNER. In Russia?
Mr. COLLINs. Yes.(Representative Francis E. Walter returned to hearing room.)
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you know how she is presently employed ?
Mr. COLLINS. NO, I don't.
Mr. TAVENNER. How was she employed at that time ?
Mr. COLLINS. I don't know that she was. I think that her husbandworked somewhere, but he wasn't-I don't recall him as in the group.,See, after all, the Communist Party, for reasons that are now evident,was not anxious to have everybody know who everybody else was,and there was, in the efforts of security, a certain amount of holdingthe same people together, especially when the work-as for instance,my work-was in specific mass organizations. I mean in the ScreenWriters' Guild, in the mobilization. So, therefore, I would knowonly except by hearsay the Communists in those particular organizations.
Mr. TAVENNER. Now, I have been asking you about the names ofvarious Communists here. I understand your reply is that in eachinstance you know of your own personal knowledge that, they weremembers of the Communist Party and you're not relying upon hearsaytestimony.246COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY
Mr. VELDE. IS that her first name or last name ?
Mr. COLLINS. That's a first name.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you acquainted with a person by the name ofAbe Polonsky ?
Mr. COLLINS. Yes.
Mr. TAVNNER. Was he known to you to be a member of the Commu-nist Party ?
Mr. COLLINS. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. What connection did he have with the HollywoodWriters' Mobilization, if any ?
Mr. COLLINS. Well, similar to Lawson's connection, which is thatPolonsky, like Lawson, is a man of undeniable intellectual capacity,is very sharp, quite talented, and he had a certain influence in'themobilization on this level. He had had, I think, as I remember, hehad been overseas in the war, and I can't tell precisely when he camehome, so that, if he was in the mobilization, it must have been in itslatter years.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was he chairman of the Atomic Energy Commissionof the Hollywood Writers' Mobilization?
Mr. COLLINS. He could have been. I don't remember exactly.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you acquainted with John Bright, B-r-i-g-h-t?
Mr. COLLINS. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was he a member'of the Communist Party?
Mr. COLLINS. Now I only remember him way back in the late thirties.He was a member in those days. But what's happened to him in thelast decade I don't know.
Mr. TAVENNER. Millard Lampell, L-a-m-p-e-l-1?
Mr. COLLINS. I can't say I was ever in a meeting with Lampell.
Mr. TAVENNER. Gertrude Purcell was a member of the board of theScreen Writers' Guild in 1938 and 1939. Were you acquainted withher?
Mr. COLLINS. Yes; I knew her.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was she a member of the Communist Party?
Mr. COLLINS. I didn't really-I didn't recall that. She might havebeen, but, as I say, I have got to remember the precise room and placeand person.
Mr. TAVENNER. Gordon Kahn, K-a-h-nMr. COLLINS. I remember-
Mr. TAVENNER (continuing). Was a member of the board.
Mr. COLLINS. I remember Kahn was in.
Mr. TAVENNER. He was a member of the Communist Party?
Mr. COLLINS. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. Have you mentioned in the course of your testimony the name of Leonardo Bercovici?
Mr. COLLINS. No. I worked with Bercovici on a film that was supposed to be about the San Francisco conference for the OWI.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you spell the name, please ?
Mr. COLLINS. B-e-r-c-o-v-i-c-i.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was he known to you to be a member of the Communist Party?
Mr. COLLINS. At that time he was.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you acquainted with a person by the name ofDorothy Tree Uris?
Mr. COLLINS. Yes; but I never knew her in the party ..247COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY
Mr. TAVENNER. You did not?
Mr. COLLINS. No.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you acquainted with an individual by thename of Sam Moore?
Mr. COLLINS. Yes; but I never knew him in the party.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you acquainted with an individual by thename of Elizabeth Leech or Elizabeth Leech Glenn ?
Mr. COLLINS. Yes. She held an official position in the CommunistParty and was also connected with the Hollywood section at one time.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did she hold any position in Hollywood as far asyou know other than as a functionary of the Communist Party?
Mr. COLLINS. She may have worked at a studio. I don't know.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was her position in the Communist Party?
Mr. COLLINS. Well, I think she took Madelaine Ruthven's job afterRuthven left, but I'm-she had some such job.
Mr. TAVENNER. By that you mean she collected dues or-Mr. COLLINS. Well, she was a secretary.
Mr. TAVENNER. A secretary?
Mr. COLLINS. I think she was an open Communist.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you acquainted with her husband, CharlesGlenn?
Mr. COLLINS. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was he a member of the Communist Party ?
Mr. COLLINS. Yes; I think he was an open Communist also.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did he serve as a functionary of the CommunistParty?
Mr. COLLINS. I don't know.I think he served as some kind of.functionary in the Hollywood section at one time.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you know an individual by the name of MargaretPotts ?
Mr. COLLINS. I don't think so..
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you acquainted with Frank Tuttle?
Mr. COLLINS. Yes; years ago.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was he a member of the Communist Party?Tut-tle? T-u-t-t-l-e?
Mr. COLmNs. He was in the early days. I went to a meetingseveral-at his house. I haven't seen him in a decade either. I don'tknow what happened to him.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you ever have occasion to meet WilliamSchneiderman ?
Mr. COLLINS. No. I saw him, but I never met him.
Mr. TAVENNER. Where did you see William Schneiderman?
Mr. COLLINS. Well,'at one of these State conventions of the partyhe made a 4-hour speech, I remember.
Mr. TAVENNER. I believe, Mr. Chairman, this is a good place fora break.
Mr. WOOD. The committee will take a recess now until 3 o'clock.(Thereupon, at 1:10 p. m., the hearing was recessed to reconveneat 3 p. m. this date.)AFTERNOON SESSION(The hearing was resumed at 2:15 p. m., the members of the committee present 'being Representatives John S. Wood (chairman),248COMMUNISMINMOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRYFrancis E. Walter, Morgan M. Moulder, Clyde Doyle, Harold H.Velde, Bernard W. Kearney, Donald L. Jackson, and Charles E.Potter.)TESTIMONY OF RICHARD J. COLLINS-Resumed
Mr. WooD. The hearing will come to order.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Collins, at this time I would like to ask youquestions regarding certain organizations which we understand youwere from time to time affiliated with.Were you at any time a member of the Hollywood Anti-NaziLeague?
Mr. COINS.Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. Can you name any other members of the CommunistParty who were members of that league along with you?
Mr. COLLINS. No. I belonged to the Anti-Nazi League before Ibecame a member of the Communist Party, and never had muchinfluence in it. I was just a rank-and-file member. So that I wouldn'tknow who was a Communist in it and who wasn't. The fact is thatthe Communists in it must have been an infinitesimal fraction of themembership, because thousands of people against Hitler were eagermembers of the Anti-Nazi League.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you know whether or not V. J. Jerome wasactive in that organization, directly or in any indirect manner?
Mr. COLLINS. I wouldn't know that either. It was before, as I say,my real experience.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you a member of the League of AmericanWriters ?
Mr. COLLINS. Yes; around 1938 or 1939; but outside of the Spanishcivil war I don't really remember what the issues were of the league,and I wouldn't want to go into it. I don't remember the content ofthe league's program at all, although I think it is all a part of thepublic record.The point is that anything that had to do with loyalist Spain, Ijoined, as I would join today, because I believe in loyalist Spain. Soif there are any organizations like the Joint Anti-Fascist Committee,I undoubtedly was a member of it.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you affiliated in any way with the ProgressiveCitizens of America ?
Mr. COLLINS. It is very possible. I am not sure.
Mr. TAVENNER. Your chief activities were confined to the Commu-nist Party itself and to the Screen Writers' Guild and the HollywoodWriters' Mobilization, rather than to Communist-front organizationsgenerally; is that true ?
Mr. COLLINS. Well, yes; I guess it is true. I mean, since I don'treally know the history of many of the organizations I joined, I wouldhave to go along with you in saying they are Communist-front organizations, although I am not sure in most cases. Anything that seemedto fulfill the program that I was interested in, I would have joined.
Mr. TAVENNER. What do you understand by a Commmnist-frontorganization, in the experience that you had in the Communist Party ?
Mr. COLLINS. Well, it seems to me that in some cases a Communistfront organization, I couldn't give you my own definition, but I assume'the meaning today is a front in which Communists are active or inwhich they organize the basis for the committee or group.COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY249
Mr. TAVENNER. Would you include those instances also in which theCommunist Party gains strong influence by infiltration of its members.into the group ?
Mr. COLLINS. Yes; if they have some influence in it I suppose youcould call it a Communist front, but there is an enormous differencebetween being a Communist and belonging to two or three organizations, especially when you take them out of the context of the yearsand go back to them.I remember in a Gallup poll around 1938 that 74 or 75 percent ofthe people said they favored the Loyalists over Franco, so that tobelong to an organization that was in favor of Loyalist Spain at thattime was a logical position. If you were against Hitler, you mighthave joined the Anti-Nazi League, and others.Coming up as late as the peace conferences, it seems to me there isa mistake made when the peace conferences are labeled "Communistfronts" and you let it go at that, because people joined the peace con-ferences not because they were Communists, but because peace is veryalive. The way to get Communist fronts out of the way is not toabolish them, but to have different kinds of organizations people canbelong to that will represent different issues which people believe invery strongly.Undoubtedly there were Communists who, for some reason or other,did not join any of those organizations, while a man might feel thatsince Communists at one time or other were associated with almostevery liberal organization in the United States, you couldn't avoidat some time being associated with Communists.
Mr. KEAnNEY. I am very glad to hear you say that. With referenceto the signatures on the "Stockholm peace petition," don't you agreethere are a lot of fine people in this country who, because the word"peace" was on it, signed that petition ?
Mr. COLLINS. I think that is absolutely true. I read an article in theNew Yorker which said the conservative members of boroughs inSwitzerland and in France had signed it because they felt it was apledge of some kind, and when they heard the Russians had signed it,they felt perhaps the Russians were pushing it along.To say everyone who signed the petition was a Communist, wouldbe a serious mistake, in my opinion. The question of peace is a veryserious question.I think also, if you go back 10 years, the situation has changed.Take American-Russian friendship. In 1942-43 it looked like a reasonable thing. So people who belonged to that in 1942-43 would bein a different category from people who would belong to'it now.
Mr. TAVENNER. I want to read from testimony given by J. EdgarHoover on this subject on March 26, 1947:For the most part, front organizations assumed the character of either a massor. membership organization or a paper organization. Both solicited and usednames of prominent persons. Literally hundreds of groups .and organizationshave either been infiltrated or organized primarily to accomplish the purposesSof promoting the interests of the Soviet Union in the United States, the promotion of Soviet war and.peace aims, the exploitation of Negroes in the UnitedStates, work among foreign-language groups, and to secure a favorable viewpointtoward the Communists in domestic, political, social, and economic issues.The first requisite for front organizations is an idealistic sounding title.Hundreds of such organizations have come into being and have gone out of existtence when their true purposes have become known or exposed while others withhigh-sounding names are continually springing up.250COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRYI would like to ask you about two other organizations. Were you amember of the People's Educational Center in Hollywood ?
Mr. COLLINS. I taught a class at what was either the People's Educa-tional Center or its equivalent. I don't know if it was called School forWriters or what it was called, but I taught a class a couple semesters.Paul Jarrico and I taught it.
Mr. TAVENNER. In addition to Paul Jarrico, were there others knownto you as Communist Party members who taught at that center?
Mr. COLLINS. There was a class in screen writing.We came in onTuesday night and we worked out a schedule, and the students didsome work and there was discussion of it.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you receive any compensation for your workin teaching ?
Mr. COLLINS. No.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did Mr. Jarrico ?
Mr. COLLINS. No. It was a work of love.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you a member of the Peace MobilizationCommittee?
Mr. COLIms. I never was active in it, but I might have had amembership in it.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you have occasion to meet Communists fromforeign countries?
Mr. CoLLINs. I met a man who was foreign editor of the FrenchCommunist paper, L'Humanitg, and he gave me the Duclos letter, orwhat was going to be the Duclos letter, before it was printed.AndI met an Indian railroad union official.
Mr. TAVENNER. You mean an official of the Government of India?
Mr. COLLINS. No; he was an official of the Railway Workers Union,as I remember.
Mr. TAVENNER. In India?
Mr. COLLINS. Yes. He was visiting here. He spoke about the con-ditions in India, the living conditions of the people in India, whichare quite severe; the fact that they eat flesh, as he says, perhaps oncea year, and many millions of people are born, live, and die in thestreet without ever being under shelter.He was enormously impressed with the amount of energy Americansmust have since they eat so well, and he was dissatisfied with theworking class of America because he didn't see how they would everbe militant men.He had looked over the country and didn't see anychance for a class struggle.
Mr. TAVENNER. He was discouraged about the prospect of com-munism among the working class in America because of the goodconditions in which they worked?
Mr. COLLINS. Yes.He said in relation to his own country it wasimpossible. He said that in his country the people had to do something, but in the United States he despaired of their interest.That is about it. I found him interesting and I remember theconversation.
Mr. TAVENNER. I want to question you a little further about yourexperience in the Communist Party. In our study of communismin various areas of the United States and in various fields, such aslabor, we have found that a very exact type of discipline is requiredwithin the Communist Party. Was that true in Hollywood?COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY251
Mr. COLLINs. No. I would say that the discipline of the intellectuals in Hollywood is quite gentle. It is probably not possible tohandle these people on the same basis as perhaps workers in otherindustries are handled. In the main, a man in Hollywood feels avery gentle party hand. There is a feeling in the party, anyway, thatintellectuals are unstable, and I think Sartre puts it very well whenhe says, "Thinking brings them in and thinking can take them out."The fact it comes out of thinking and not absolute need is the thingthat makes it not possible to put such a clamp on the membership asmay be true in other places.On the other hand, I discovered when I started to disagree violentlyI was not popular. But I could disagree as I did in the Maltz controversy, where I supported Maltz, without anyone discussing it withme or any discipline at all. There is a fair freedom. I don't thinkthe party could keep the people if there wasn't. But on basic questions they have to accept the policy of the party. On small pointsthere can be arguments and disagreements.It also depends on how strong the party is. In 1946 and 1947 theywere very gentle, because their position was poor and they didn'twant to get rid of people who disagreed; but in the days they weregoing well, I think they would have asked a man who was difficultto leave. Later on they didn't like to lose anybody.
Mr. TAVENNER. YOU state that in major matters of policy you wererequired to carry out party lines and instructions?
Mr. COLLINS. Yes. In a thing like the German-Russian Pact, youwould have to accept the policy of the party.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you know of any instance in which party discipline was attempted of any member of the cell or branch to whichyou were attached ?
Mr. COLLINS. You might call it discipline; it came out of the Duclosletter. After the Duclos letter, it revised the Communist Party'sthinking of how postwar America would be. Browder thought theremight be some peaceful transition to socialism, and so on. Mr. Duclosapparently didn't agree with this, and sent a letter to the AmericanParty saying that Browder had strayed from the Marxist position,and it caused a great furor in the party.This was one of the things which I suppose was the turning pointin my party life.
Mr. VELDE. Will you place a date on that incident ?
Mr. COLLIS. That was June 1945. The situation was that a manwho loved Browder on Monday hated him on Thursday. Once thenational committee of the Communist Party said he was no good,the chorus filled the room. The party indulged in what was termed"self-criticism." I could not quite accept the self-criticism. It seemedabsurd, since in order to have been a member of the party previouslyit was necessary to go along with the Browder position, and in orderto stay in the party subsequently it was necessary to change that position and so therefore the confession of error was not individual butmass, and as such seemed to me to have no value.The whole situation was reviewed, and John Howard Lawson wasreviewed as well, and he was relieved of his position of responsibility.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was that position at that time ?
Mr. COLLNS. Whatever it was, in fact it was the leadership of thesection. The leadership was then given to other people, I think to252COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRYWaldo Salt and Charles Glenn, and much to our surprise we discovered that Jack Lawson was the liaison between the county and the section, having been given the job by the county, which made him onceagain the leader of the section.
Mr. TAVENNER. Let us be certain that we get that in an understandable way. As a result of the Duclos letter, there was initiateda proceeding to oust him from his position of leadership?
Mr. COLLINS. There was a review of the entire leadership, nation-ally. Then in all the local committees this presumably took place.
Mr. TAVENNER. Who initiated this action?
Mr. COLLNS. In a new committee, I think, each branch had onerepresentative.
Mr. TAVENNER. What part did you take in it?
Mr. COLLINS. I was the representative from my branch.Anothercommittee had prepared this document on Lawson after talking tohim. They prepared documents on others, too. I went downtownwhen Nemmy Sparks was in charge and presented my position regarding Lawson, and Nemmy Sparks listened to it quite coldly.
Mr. TAVENNER. Who was Nemmy Sparks ?
Mr. COLLINS. Organizer in Los Angeles County. He listenedclosely and I was subsequently stripped of my epaulets and I held noposition in the party.
Mr. TAVENNER. After taking action which you thought removedLawson from the position he then held, he was placed in the sameposition, though known under a different title?lMr. COLLNS. Yes.As I look back, I think Nemmy Sparks wasright in supporting Lawson instead of supporting me, from the Communist Party point of view.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are there any other instances concerning Commu-nist Party discipline ?
Mr. COLLINS. Not that I remember.I think a great many people like me were profoundly disturbed bythe events following the Duclos letter-the Maltz incident was afterthat-and I know people who are either out or thinking of going outof the party.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you repeat that, please?
Mr. COLLINS. There were a good many people after the Duclos letterand after the Maltz incident who were dissatisfied and wanted to getout of the party. Some have gotten out and some have not.It is hard to get out, not because anybody tells you you can't buttbecause you have associations of many years, and you have liberalquestion that you believed in together, and probably still do, and youhave many hours of energy and time invested, and it is only whenissues become sharp that decisions are made.
Mr. TAVENNER. It requires more courage to get out than get in?
Mr. COLLINS. I don't know. I think it takes something to get out.I don't know what it is.
Mr. TAVENNER. You were in a position to observe the variousswitches in the Communist Party line during the period you were amember. Will you give the committee the benefit of your knowledgeregarding certain outstanding instances of Communist Party switches?
Mr. COLLINS. One of the main switches prior to the Duclos letterwas the Nazi-Soviet pact. Prior to the Nazi-Soviet pact, the SovietCOMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY253Union's position of collective security against Nazi Germany was agood position and had my support. The Soviet Union also helpedLoyalist Spain.When the Nazi-Soviet pact occurred there was great consternationon the part of many people. It didn't seem reasonable for this pactto have been made. The explanation was given to me by Sam Ornitz,the great explainerMr. TAVENNER. IS he one of the 10 who appeared before this committee in 1947 ?
Mr. COLLINS. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. I believe you have already identified him as a mem-ber of the Communist Party ?
Mr. COLLINS. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. Proceed.
Mr. COLLINS. Ornitz explained right away what was subsequentlythe position taken by the party, that this was a delaying tactic on thepart of Soviet Russia because they were not prepared at that timeto go to war.It was about June 21, 1941, whell the Soviet Union was attackedby Nazi Germany.
Mr. TAVENNER. What propaganda efforts were made during thatperiod to support the various lines of the Communist Party ?
Mr. COLLINS. I don't remember that we did. I remember the slogan,"The Yanks are not Coming," and so on. A lot of organizations weresmashed during that period.Next was the Finland question. The Finland question did do alot of harm to the Communists so far as mass organizations and so on.What had happened when Germany attacked Soviet Russia wasexplained again by Sam Ornitz in a social gathering, and he explainedit by saying it was now a good war, because the entrance of the SovietUnion had changed the character of the war. Before then it was a.bad war. Now it was a good war.
Mr. TAVENNER. This individual took the position it was a good warbetween Russia and Germany, but a bad war between the UnitedStates and Germany
Mr. COLLINS. At that time the United States was not officially inthe war.The last switch was the switch surrounding the Duclos letter, andit was the switch that brought about my exit, which I will admit took.me a long time. It took me a long time to get in and it took me a longtime to get out.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was there any change in direction about the use ofnames for branches after the Duclos letter?
Mr. COLLINS. I also recall that a cute instance was that the brancheswere to, take the names of Communists who were heroes, but it wasexplained they should be dead.
Mr. TAVENNER. Dead Communists ?
Mr. COLLINS. Dead Communists, because, as in the case of Browder,you never could tell. Therefore they were given names of dead Communists.I was going to go into the question about the Screen Writers' Guild.We had no fraction meetings and had to rely to some degree on Lawson's leadership on the guild board.254COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRYThis was the period the policy had changed from a no-strike policyto a support of the strike. There was a tremendous amount of shillyshallying, so that when I got to the board I didn't know how I wouldvote. Lawson made a speech, and then we voted. For the first timeI was getting very uncomfortable with this kind of procedure.
Mr. TAVENNER. In that connection, the Communist Party has madean effort to claim it is democratic in the conduct of its business. Areyou commenting now upon that claim of democratic type of action ?
Mr. COLLINS. Well, it was democratic in the sense that if we diddiscuss it there would be general agreement, presumably, and if youdisagreed you went with the majority.To go back to this, Dudley NicholsMr. TAVENNER. Was he a member of the Communist Party?
Mr. COLLINS. No. Spoke for support of the secretaries. We beathim down. We had a no-strike policy. Six months later John Howard Lawson was saying to the Screen Writers' Guild board that weshould support the strike. And Frank Partos, also on the board, said,"Please, I ask you, are we saying what we said 6 months ago."I found it was hard to take. In 1947 I decided I was not going torun for the board. I wanted to withdraw. I must say the party wasnot against my not running as I had disobeyed several directives.I think that covers the switches.
Mr. TAVENNER. That all led up to about the time you terminated.your relationship with the Communist Party ?
Mr. COLLINS. In 1947 I was subpenaed to come here to Washingtonbefore this committee. I found myself with a group of Communistsand non-Communists. I found I didn't have the guts to break withmen I knew and liked personally. I went to New York.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was your purpose in going to New York?
Mr. COLLINS. It was to get out of political activity. It was not thecourageous thing to do; but I did it.
Mr. TAVENNER. That is, to break with those you had been associatedwith in the Communist Party.
Mr. COLLINS. Yes. I came back at Christmas time in 1947 and wapasked for my dues for the year and I refused, but I didn't refuse ona clear-cut basis. I kind of weasled out of it.
Mr. TAVENNER. Who demanded the payment of the dues
Mr. COLLINS. Nobody demanded it. Jarrico suggested it, and I saidno.In 1948, toward the end of 1948, I came back-no, it was about themiddle of 1949 that I came back. When I came back Jarrico askedme whether I was going to come back to the party, and for the firsttime I said no. I still did not explain my position completely. I saidno I wasn't. This state of affairs lasted until 1950.In 1950 I was beginning to be extremely uncomfortable with myposition, which was that I was considered a Communist by almost allof Hollywood, and I was considered a renegade by my ex-associates.Also, I had the fear, which became a nightmare, that it the event ofa war with the Soviet Union I would be considered a friend of theSoviet Union.By that time I had made steps to being anti-Soviet, in the sense thatI did not believe the Soviet's presentation of the state of the world,nor did I believe it was a paradise. I had a real fear that I would beCOMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY255considered, in the event of such a war, a friend of the Soviet Union,when actually I was an enemy.Accordingly, I went in February 1950 to the Federal Bureau ofInvestigation with a note in which I said I had been a Communist,was one no longer, wanted my loyalty to the United States understood, but at that time I didn't wish to discuss my former associates.They honored that. We discussed the workings of the party, however.
Mr. TAVENNER. Have you engaged in any Communist Party activi-ties since your break with the party in 1947 to 1949 ? I think thebreak occurred during that period ?
Mr. COLLINS. I did do what could be called, I suppose, Communistactivity, although I did not think of it as such at that time. I participated in the organization of a peace meeting in 1948. I alsosigned for personal reasons, whenever I could, such as the amicuscuriae brief, for men with whom I had been associated. As far as Irecall, that is about it. I did go along with the peace movement for acertain length of time. I went to the peace conference at the WaldorfAstoria Hotel, and went to Madison Square Garden and listened to thespeeches. I remember those things.
Mr. TAVENNER. Other than the things you have mentioned, haveyou engaged in any other Communist Party activity?
Mr. COLLINS. I have engaged in no Communist Party activity atall, nor do I intend to.
Mr. TAVENNER. You consider that your break with the party isdefinite and final?
Mr. COLLINS. I consider it irrevocable, and I imagine the partydoes too.
Mr. TAVENNER. When was the subpena to appear here before thiscommittee served upon you, do you recall?
Mr. COLLINS. About 5 weeks ago, I think.
Mr. TAVENNER. The subpena shows the date February 28, 1951.
Mr. COLLINS. That is probably right.
Mr. TAVENNER. Has any effort been made, since the service of thatsubpena upon you, to dissuade you from making a full disclosure tothis committee of all you know regarding communism?
Mr. COLLINS. Well, there was one effort made; yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you tell the committee about it?
Mr. COLLINS. Well, a couple weeks ago, or 10 days ago, I re-ceived a phone call from Paul Jarrico, who said he would like to seeme. I asked him to come over, which he did, after dinner.He said he understood I had made some arrangements with this committee, and I should be careful with such arrangements. I don'tthink he realized the depths of my perfidy at this point.He asked if I would give my personal assurance that I would notgive any names. He understood I was out of the party, but he wantedmy personal assurance that I would not give any names. I didn'tgive that assurance.We then had a long political discussion. Paul Jarrico feels thejustice of his position, and he went over the situation that he believesthe Soviet Union is devoted to the interests of all people and is peaceloving as well.I said'to him, "It is not for me.not for me."It may be a fine country, but it is256COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRYHe said, "How can you be so sure ?"I said, "I can be sure because I was in the Communist Party almost10 years, and having lived through that I can tell that is not the kindof country I would like to live in."I looked at my watch and it was a quarter of 12, after 4 hours ofdiscussion, and he said, "I think on the basis of 14 years of friendshipI have the right to ask for your personal assurance'that you will notgive any names."I said, "I will give you my personal assurance that I will not giveany names if you will give me your personal assurance that in theevent of a war between the United States and the Soviet Union youwill do nothing to help the Soviet Union."Paul said, "You know my answer to that." He didn't explain theanswer, but is was that if it was an aggressive war of the United Stateshe would not support it.I said, "I am not interested in whether it is aggressive. I want yourpersonal assurance that if there is war between this country and theSoviet Union you will do nothing to help the Soviet Union."Since he could not give me this assurance, I would not give him mine,and since we would not lie to each other, we had no further conversation.
Mr. TAVENNER. I have no further questions.
Mr. WooD. Mr. Walter.
Mr. WALTER. In these days of disclosures of disloyalty, it is re-freshing to find someone who has the courage to make a contributionto the security of the United States, and I trust you have made anexample for other people who must by this time know that the aims ofthe United States are for peace.
Mr. WOOD. Mr. Doyle.
Mr. DOYLE. I have quite a few questions, but in view of the shorttime remaining, I wish to ask the witness only one or two short ones.Have you ever had time, or have you ever read, the law under whichthis committee operates? Have you ever had that called to your attention ?
Mr. COLLINS. NO, I don't think so.
Mr. DOYLE. Let me read it to you.The Committee on Un-American Activities, as a whole or by subcommittee, isauthorized to make from time to time investigations of (1) the extent, character,and objects of un-American propaganda activities in the United States (2) thediffusion within the United States of subversive and un-American propagandathat is instigated from foreign countries or of a domestic origin and attacksthe principle of the form of government as guaranteed by our Constitution, and(3) all other questions in relation thereto that would aid Congress in any necessary remedial legislation.Have you any suggestion to Congress as to any remedial legislationwhich might be considered fairly within our Constitution to meet thisproblem of subversive misconduct and un-American activities?
Mr. COLLINS. I can't say I have.That is a field way outside myknowledge and experience.
Mr. DOYLE. What is your answer to this question: Do you feel,then, that this committee, functioning as it has, say with you today,and as you have known it to function by written report and by hearsay,is serving a valuable function to meet this problemCOMMUNISM INMOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY257I
Mr. COLLINS. Well, it has served a valuable function as far asam concerned in that it has given me an opportunity to clear myself,and it gives that possibility to other people. Insofar as its other activities, I still could not comment on it because I am not familiarenough with it.
Mr. DoYLE. I call your attention to the common understandingof term "subversive" and the technical definition of the term "subvert." I took occasion to look it up several days ago, and it means,"To overturn from the foundation; to overthrow; to ruin utterly;to destroy; also, to upset, uproot, or the like."Is it your opinion that the Communist Party of the United States,as you knew it when you were a member of it, was favoring the subversive destruction of the constitutional form of government as weknow it in this country ?
Mr. COLLINS. Well, I suppose in the sense that it favors the Sovietregime, it favors the destruction of the Constitution, but insofar asmy activities were concerned, I could scarcely say that is true. Theactivities I was engaged in until the time I left were not disloyalto the United States. They may have been misguided, but disloyalthey were not. Since the aim eventually is a Soviet state, that certainlywould not be constitutional government as we have it.
Mr. DOYLE. Thank you very much. I get the difference. In otherwords, your experience had no such purpose ?
Mr. COLLINS. That is right.
Mr. DOYLE. Whereas the purpose of the Communist Party of theUnited States, as I take it from your last statement, is to set up aSoviet form of government in the United States, in the world?
Mr. COLLINS. Yes. But it is a long step between an eventual goaland possibilities. In other words, the people who become Communists, at least in my time, didn't join because the Communists weregoing to overthrow our form of government by force and violence.
Mr. DOYLE. Was there any change later ?
Mr. COLLINS. No. Now, because of the worsened conditions, no onecan be on the side of the United States and the Communists at the sametime. During the earlier period there didn't seem to be a divergencebetween the position of Soviet Russia and of the United States, notuntil 1946, when the cold war became sharper.
Mr. WooD. Mr. Velde.
Mr. VELDE. Due to the shortness of time I just wanted to take theopportunity to thank Mr. Collins for coming before the committeeand answering questions frankly and openly, as it appears to me, andgiving this valuable information to the committee as to the techniquesof the Communist Party in organizing the underground, and I hopethis will serve as an example to others called before the committee.
Mr. WooD. General Kearney.
Mr. KEARNEY. I want to add my personal thanks to the witness forcoming here and testifying today.
Mr. WooD. Mr. Jackson.
Mr. JACKSON. In all, how many active members of the CommunistParty did you know in Hollywood ?
Mr. COLLINS. I knew, I suppose, about 20, but I understood thatthere were many, many more. Mr. JACKSON. What would your best estimate be as to membershipat its peak during the war ?COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY
Mr. COLLINS. Several hundred.
Mr. JACKSON. Several hundred. And of those of whom you havepersonal knowledge, how many have broken with the party so far?
Mr. COLLINS. About one-fourth.
Mr. JACKSON. About 25 percent?
Mr. COLLINS. Yes.
Mr. JACKSON. Have broken with the party ?
Mr. COLLINS. Broken in various degrees. Some have broken inthat they don't go to meetings, and some have broken because theydon't believe in it.
Mr. JACKSON. In varying degrees, 75 percent might be consideredto belong actively or to be in the fellow-traveler classification ?
Mr. COLLINS. Yes. In the event of a real show-down it is hard tosay how many would stay. I have detected signs of disturbance inpeople in whom I never detected it before.
Mr. JACKSON. I join with other members of the committee in sayingI feel you not only have rendered a service to yourself, but I believeyou have rendered a distinct service to the country.
Mr. WOOD. Mr. Potter.
Mr. POTTER. You stated that if you had appeared before the com-mittee in 1947 you would not have testified ?
Mr. COLLINS. I would have taken, the line taken by the othermembers.
Mr. POTTER. What was the reason for that?
Mr. COLLINS. It would be because at that time it seemed to me thatpurely on American democratic constitutional grounds there was aquestion of the propriety of asking a man his political beliefs. Without gong into the question of its propriety today, there has been amarked change in the world situation since 1947, and there has beenas great a change in me. It is hard to tell where one thing beginsand the other ends.
Mr. POTTER. That is all. You have been a very willing witness.
Mr. WooD. There has been testimony indicating that individualshave been approached on the proposition of being passive membersof the party, contributing to it in the form of dues or otherwise, butnot taking active part. Do you know of any such approach ?
Mr. COLLINS. No.That would have been a recent development,when people might feel it is too hot, or because they might have slightdisagreements, but would still be willing to contribute money. ButI would say that when one leaves the party, as has been said, theystart out a little ways and then they go a long ways. Once theylive in a different world, it is very hard for them to go back.
Mr. WooD. I join with other members of the committee in ex-pressing appreciation for your cooperation and for the very frankand full manner in which you have given information, and unless thecommittee determines at some future time to ask your appearance, youwill be excused, and the committee stands adjourned until 10 o'clocktomorrow morning.(Thereupon, at 4: 30 p. m. on Thursday, April 12, 1951, an adjournment was taken until Friday, April 13, 1951, at 10 a. m.)COMMUNIST INFILTRATION OF HOLLYWOOD MOTIONPICTURE INDUSTRY-PART 1FRIDAY, APRIL 13, 1951UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,COMMITTEE ON UN-AMERICAN ACTIVITIES,Washington, D.

Mr. TAVENNER. Are you employed in the industry at this time?
Mr. SALT. Not exactly at this time.
Mr. TAVENNER What was the nature of your last employment inthe industry ?
Mr. SALT. I was at work on an original screen play for Norma Pro-ductions, which is an independent with Warner Bros.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was the name of the company ?
Mr. SALT. Norma, as in the girl's name.
Mr. TAVENNER. What other employment have you had in Hollywoodbesides that ? What are some of the principal pictures in which youhave worked as a writer ?
Mr. SALT. From present to past, or past to present?
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, you begin either way you desire.
Mr. SALT. I started as a junior writer. Shall I give a history?
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes; I believe that would be more satisfactory ifyou would start from the beginning and tell about your experienceand career in Hollywood.
Mr. SALT. I began as a junior writer, I believe I was 20 years old,at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer; worked there for 5 years, 51/ years.
Mr. TAVENNER. And when was that?
Mr. SALT. I think it began in 1936 and ran through to 1941, as Iremember. During that period I had credit on Shopworn Angel; ina picture called Wild Man of Borneo in collaborationMr. TAVENNER. Will you speak a little louder?
Mr. SALT. I am sorry.
Mr. WooD. The members of the committee can't hear you up here.
Mr. SALT. I am very sorry. The picture Shopworn Angel and thepicture Wild Man of Borneo, for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The pictureTonight We Raid Calais, for Twentieth Century Fox. Mr. WinkleGoes to War, for Columbia. Rachel and the Stranger, for RKO. Andthe most recent, The Flame and the Arrow, for Warner Bros. andNorma Productions.
Mr. TAVENNER. The last picture to which you referred, The Flaming ArrowMr. SALT. The Flame and the Arrow.
Mr. TAVENNER (continuing).-The Flame and the Arrow was basedupon the book of Albert Maltz, was it not ?
Mr. SALT. No; it was an original screen play.
Mr. TAVENNER. By you?COMMUNISM INMOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY261
Mr. SALT. By me.
Mr. TAVENNER. What agency has represented you in the past 4 or5 years if any?
Mr. SALT. I think that I have been represented by 2 in the past 5years. I am not sure. I am now with Sam Jaffe Agency.that I was with the M. C. Levee, L-e-v-e-e, Agency.Before
Mr. TAVENNER. What was the date of the change from one to theother?
Mr. SALT. I think that may have been 4 years ago. I am not sure.
Mr. TAVENNER. You spoke of having been engaged in the teachingprofession at one time. Were you a member of the faculty of theSchool for Writers in Hollywood?
Mr. SALT. Which School for Writers is that?
Mr. TAVENNER. The school that was conducted under the auspicesof the League of American Writers.
Mr. SALT. At this point I think that we might as well be very clear.I am going to claim the privilege of the fifth amendment here, as otherwitnesses have, because a number of organizations, their membership,individually and collectively, have been incriminated already by publication of lists without sufficient evidence, chance to cross-examine thewitnesses against them; have been printed up in leaflets and in publications such as this; andMr. WooD. Suppose you just make your answer responsive to thequestion asked. If any question is asked you that you think wouldincriminate you by giving a truthful answer to it, you have the rightto claim' that privilege if you want to claim it. I want to say to youthat to the question asked, a truthful answer could not possibly incriminate you under any law in existence today, but if you want toclaim the privilege, it is all right with this committee. There canonly be one of two connotations. So please make your answers responsive to the questions asked and we will get along faster and savea lot of time.
Mr. SALT. I am extremely anxious to get along fast.
Mr. WooD. Make your answers responsive.
Mr. SALT. I would like to make quite clear the legal grounds onwhich I am proceeding.
Mr. WOOD. We understand the provisions of the fifth amendmentand also the first amendment of the American Constitution.on those grounds, that is all you need to say.If it is
Mr. SALT. I would like to add this qualification, Mr. Wood, that Ihave sat through several days of your hearings here, and in particularI noticed you did not object when one of your witnesses, Mr. Hayden,said to claim the privilege of the fifth amendment implied guilt. I-know this is not true. I am sure you know it is not true.
Mr. WooD. If it is not true, then your claiming it is a false statement on your part.
Mr. SALT. NO. I think there may be a very serious misinterpretation of the fifth amendment here.
Mr. Woon. Just answer the questions, please, without undertakingto lecture the committee, and I think we will get along faster.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do I understand you have refused to answer thequestion ?262
Mr.COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRYSALT.I have not yet.I was stating my grounds.In rela-tion to the organizations listed in addition to the 643 already labeledas subversive by your committee, I feel that I must claim the privilegeof the fifth amendment, refuse to answer that on the grounds that itmight tend to incriminate me.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you at any time a member of the board ofdirectors or other governing body of Actors' Laboratory, Inc. ?
Mr. SALT. I am sure that the Actors' Laboratory is included there.It was investigated by Jack Tenney. 1
Mr. WooD. What is your answer to the question ?
Mr. SALT. Therefore I decline to answer on the grounds previouslystated.
Mr. TAVESNNER. Did you make an announcement in the Daily People's World of January 20, 1944, supporting the formation of a groupm Los Angeles to work for the release of Morris U. Schappes ?
Mr. SALT. Again 1 am sure that it is obvious that I would claimthe privilegeMr. KEARNEY. Mr. Chairman, may I suggest that he answer "yes"or "no," and if he feels it is going to incriminate him, to so state,instead of going into a long harangue ?
Mr. WOOD. Yes.
Mr. SALT. I will repeat my last answer.privilege.Again I must claim theI am sorry if that is a harangue.
Mr. TAVENNER. Morris U. Schappes was the teacher at City Collegein New York who was indicted and convicted for perjury in connection with an investigation of his alleged Communist Party activities at this institution, and I want to ask whether or not you organizedor assisted in organizing a movement in California to petition Governor Dewey to commute his sentence ?
Mr. SALT. Again 1 decline on the grounds that this requires meto give evidence against myself.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you a candidate for the executive board ofthe .Hollywood Arts, Sciences, and Professions Council of the Progressive Citizens of America in 1947 ?
Mr. SALT. I must decline on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you also a candidate for the executive boardin 1951?
Mr. SALT. That is the same question; same answer.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you a sponsor of the State-wide Conference onCivil Rights which was held in San Francisco, September 27 and 28,1941 ?
Mr. SALT. I am sure that this question falls into the same categoryas earlier questions. I decline to answer on the grounds that it mighttend to incriminate me.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you testify under oath before the CaliforniaState Committee on Un-American Activities in 1944
Mr. SALT. Is that the Tenney committee ?
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes.
Mr. SALT. I believe yes. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you testify under oath at that time and beforethat committee in 1944 that you were a member of the HollywoodDemocratic Committee?1 State Senator Jack B. Tenney, of the California State Legislature.COMMUNISMINMOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY263
Mr. SALT. Again, in the context of today, I must refuse to answerthat on the grounds that it might tend to incriminate me.
Mr. TAVENNER. You take that position notwithstanding you testified under oath to that fact in 1944, if you did so testify ?
Mr. SALT. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you also testify under oath before that com-mittee in 1944 that you attended a surprise birthday party for CarlWinter at his home on September 24, 1944 ?
Mr. SALT. Again, in the context of today, I must decline to answerthat on the grounds that it might tend to be self-incriminating.
Mr. TAVENNER. How. could it incriminate you today to advise this-committee regarding the facts of a matter which you did testify tounder oath in 1944?
Mr. SALT. I don't want to go into any harangues. As a taxpayer, Iam as anxious to see these hearings end as soon as possible. I disapprove of this entire tendency of government toward governmentby quiz show. I think it is rather obvious, as the witness yesterdaysaid, that the world situation has altered radically between even 1947and now.
Mr. TAVENNER. But my question to you, how could it incriminateyou nowMr. SALT. The world situation and theMr. TAVENNER (continuing). To make a statement of fact regard-ing a matter which you have testified under oath about at a previoustime before another committee ?
Mr. SALT. The world situation and the laws and the situation ofthis country have changed quite radically since then.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you one of the signers of the nominatingposition of Albert Maltz in November 1949 for a position on the executive board of the Screen Writers' Guild ?
Mr. SALT. I believe that is a matter of public record; not public,but I think it is a matter of record.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was that what was known as the so-called progres-sive section or part of the Screen Writers' Guild ? Was that in connection with the slate presented by that group ?
Mr. SALT. May I consult with counsel for a moment on this?
Mr. TAVENNER. Surely.(Witness and his counsel conferred.)
Mr. SALT. The fact is that I signed for Albert Maltz, petitioningthat he be a nominee for the Screen Writers' Guild, as an individual,because I felt that Albert Maltz would make a very fine representative of the writers.
Mr. WooD. You were not asked for your reason for doing it.Youwere asked if you did do it.
Mr. SALT. I will testify to the fact that I signed for Albert Maltz.However, I think that when it goes beyond this' into the question ofany organizational activity within the Guild, since yesterday andthe testimony of your witness, that again I must claim the privilegehere on the ground of the fifth amendment, as previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was he defeated in that election. Mr. SALT. As I remember, and with my memory refreshed by testimony, I believe he was.264COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you affiliated with the agricultural aid committee of the United Cannery, Packing and Allied Workers ofAmerica, of which committee you were alleged to be the chairman?
Mr. SALT. I am quite sure that the United Cannery, Packing andAllied Workers of America is one of the trade-unions that you haveseen fit to include in your list as subversive, and on this ground Iwill decline to answer as previously justified under the fifth amendment.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Salt, the Cultural and Scientific Conferencefor World Pace was held in New York City from March 25 throughMarch 27, 1949, and this conference was attended by delegates fromforeign countries as well as from this country. Did you endeavor toestablish a comparable conference to be held in California-or inHollywood, to be specific-at which you planned that many of theseforeign delegates would appear as speakers in the Cultural and Scientific Conference which you desired to hold there, that is, "Conference for Peace," so called?
Mr. SALT. You have a special report on the so-called "CommunistPeace Offensive," so I will have to, obviously, decline to answer thaton the grounds previously stated.
Mr. WOOD. Well it isn't obvious to me. I don't know if it is obviousto the other members of the committee or not. Do you decline toanswer ?
Mr. SALT. I decline to answer on the grounds previously stated, Mr.Chairman.
Mr. WOOD. Very well.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you ever attend a meeting at which a personby the name of Alexander Stevens, or J. Peters, was present?
Mr. SALT. I decline to answer on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you acquainted with Lionel Berman?
Mr. SALT. I decline to answer on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Have you met with John Stapp in your home ?
Mr. SALT. I decline to answer on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you have a meeting with Alexander Trachtenberg in Los Angeles in the year 1943 ?
Mr. SALT. I decline to answer on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. The committee has information, Mr. Salt, that youwere issued in 1945 Communist Political Association registration cardbearing number 47232. Were you the holder of such a card.
Mr. SALT. Decline to answer on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you the holder of a membership card in theCommunist Party for the year 1945, or rather in the CommunistPolitical Association for that year?
Mr. SALT. That is a rephrasing, isn't it, of the -last question, Mr.Tavenner ?
Mr. TAVENNER. Not entirely.
Mr. SALT. It is similar.
Mr. TAVENNER. It is related, of course.
Mr. SALT. It is related; therefore I similarly decline to answer onthe grounds previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you issued a registration card for the year1944 bearing number 47182, by the Communist Party ?COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY265
Mr. SALT. Similarly, this is a related question, and in claiming theprivilege of the fifth amendment I would like to say that this and anumber of other questions could undoubtedly be answered proudly"yes" or "no" in many countries of the world today, most of the coun-tries outside of this, Spain, ArgentinaMr. WOOD. You are asked to answer in this country, now.
Mr. SALT. Yes; and in this country, again, I must decline to answerunder the protection of the fifth amendment of the Constitution.
Mr. WALTER. The countries in which you feel that this questioncould be answered proudly are the countries behind the iron curtain.Was that your meaning?
Mr. SALT. NO; that was not my meaning.
Mr. KEARNEY. Those countries are the countries where they do nothave the protection of the fifth amendment.
Mr. SALT. I was referring to most of the countries of the worldwho are still operating on the basis of the example originally set bythis brave, proud, fine country of ours, who have patterned theirsystem of freedom and justice and political liberty on our own country's, which I think we are slipping away from now, which makes itquite impossible for a man to answer freely, to speak up freely.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you a member of the Communist Party at anytime during the year 1945 ?
Mr. SALT. Again this seems to me to be a rephrasing of a previousquestion, Mr. Tavenner.
Mr. TAVENNER. What is your answer?
Mr. SALT. I decline to answer that on the grounds previously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you an employee in the Office of War Infor-mation during the year 1945 ?
Mr. SALT. Yes.mation.Yes; I was employed by the Office of War Infor-
Mr. TAVENNER. Tell us when that employment began and when itended.
Mr. SALT. I can't be surely specific about this.I believe it beganin the early months of 1945 and ended with the summer of 1945.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was the nature of your duties and your assignment ?
Mr. SALT. I was assigned on what was called the writer-directorclassification.I worked on a film called The Cummington Story.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was the name of the story?
Mr. SAvr. The Cummington Story.It was a film based on agroup of European refugees received in a town of Cummington,Mass., I believe. Following that I worked on the film called SanFrancisco 1945, which was a film expressing our point of view towardthe San Francisco Conference.
Mr. TAVENNER. Whose point of view ?
Mr. SALT. The United States'.
Mr. TAVENNER. In obtaining employment in the Office of War In-formation, did you take an oath?(No response.)
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you ?
Mr. SALT. Is that a question?
Mr. TAVENNER. Certainly. I asked you if you took an oath in ob-taining your position with the Office of War Information.266
Mr.COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURESALT.INDUSTRY -The word "obtained" confused me. I thought it had todo with seeking it. I did not seek it. I was invited.
Mr. TAVENNER. The emphasis is on the oath.
Mr. SALT. I think I probably did. As I remember, there is someform of an oath included in one of the applications, is there not ?
Mr.. TAVENNER. What is the oath? Do you recall it?
Mr. SMAT. No; I am not sure that I do.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you recall whether or not you signed an oaththat you were not a member of any political party or organizationthat advocated the overthrow of the Government of the UnitedStates ?
Mr. SALT. I don't recall the specific wording of that oath.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, were you in April of 1945 a member of anypolitical party or organization that advocated the overthrow of theGovernment?
Mr. SALT. Well, again, quoting Mr. Collins, the world situationhas changed a great deal since 1947. The legal rights and the political rights of the individual of this country have changed a great dealsince 1947. Various individual interpretations, definitions, have beenwritten into law since then. I believe that this question, again, takesme into an area which might lead to or tend to incriminate me.
Mr. TAVENNER. Incriminate you in what way ? What do you meanby tending to incriminate you in the answer to the question as towhether or not, at the time you took the oath which you say you took,you were a member of a political party or organization that advocated the overthrow of the Government?
Mr. SALT. Same answer, Mr. Tavenner.
Mr. TAVENNER. If you executed an oath in April 1945 that you werenot a member of a political party or association that advocated theoverthrow of the Government, was it true or false?
Mr. SALT. Same answer.
Mr. TAVENNER. You have made reference several times to the testi-mony of the witness-who appeared here yesterday, Mr. Richard Collins. Mr. Collins testified that he brought you into the CommunistParty. Is that testimony true or false ?
Mr. SALT. Same answer, Mr. Tavenner.
Mr. TAVENNER. What answer is that?
Mr. SALT. I decline to answer.
Mr. TAVENNER. On what ground?
Mr. SALT. On the ground of the fifth amendment, that such ananswer might tend to incriminate me, or, put more specifically withinmy understanding of the law, might lead to the possibility of prosecution-not conviction or guilt nor any presumption at all of convictionor guilt, but might simply tend to lead to the possibility of prosecution.This, I believe, is the actual legal status of the fifth amendment, theclaim to the privilege. I am sorry Mr. Velde is not here, from Illinois,because I am a native of the State of Illinois, and I am informed bycounsel, and rather proud of the fact, that in Illinois the courts haveruled that the claim of the privilege of the fifth amendment is notonly a right but a duty of the citizen, and that any tendency to saythat the claim of the privilege against self-incrimination is in itselfincriminating, would be to distort, to stand on its head, and twist beyond any possible reasoned meaning the intent of the Constitution asCOMMUNISM INMOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY267written by our founding fathers, who intended particularly to protectindividuals against political inquiry, against inquiry into heresy.
Mr. TAVENNER. Is that all ?
Mr. SALT. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. I have no further questions, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. WooD. Mr. Walter.
Mr. WALTER. You have testified that in 1945 you were invitedto become associated with OWI. Who was it that asked you to takethat position ?
Mr. SALT. I was asked by the OWI representatives. I don't knowexactly which one. I believe that the official in charge responsible atthat time was Mr. Robert Riskin, who was head of the Overseas FilmDivision.
Mr. WALTER. Did you know Mr. Riskin ?
Mr. SALT. I have never met him.
Mr. WALTER. Was it Mr. Riskin who interviewed you when youobtained your position ?
Mr. SALT. No; I believe not. Mr. Riskin was at that time, I believe,in New York. I was in Hollywood.
Mr. WALTER. Who interviewed you in Hollywood ?
Mr. SALT. A man named Smith whose first name, unfortunately,escapes me, and I realize his rather poor identification, although Ithink if you go to the records of the OWI Overseas Film Unit-Mr. WALTER. Yes; we will find out who it was. Where did thisinterview take place ?
Mr. SALT. In Hollywood.
Mr. WALTER. DO you know who it was that recommended you toRiskin?
Mr. SALT. No; this I don't know. I think this is rather like employ-ment in any other sense in Hollywood. The OWI information programhad rather extensive needs, as you know, and required the services ofa great many writers-directors. The full and clear statement of thiscountry's position required all kinds of services. It was not easily donein film. So that I believe a great many writers from time to time didparticipate on a volunteer basis and in many other ways, and the hiringand firing of people was done on rather the same basis it would be donein a studio, on the basis of reputation, background, motion-picturecredits.
Mr. WALTER. You declined to answer the question as to whetheror not Mr. Richard Collins recruited you into the Communist Party.If he did not, why don't you just say "No; he did not"
Mr. SALT. This is the same question put in another way.
Mr. WALTER. No; it isn't the same question. I don't like to takea lot of time, but after all, we realize the difference in world conditions. It certainly seems to me that as of today those who applaudedthe efforts of Russia a few years ago might well take the position that,"At that moment I was entirely justified in doing whatever I did.Today conditions are so obviously different that I feel I owe it to thiscountry, that has given me so much, to indicate the activities so thatthe Congress of the United States may intelligently legislate in thefield of national security."
Mr. SALT. That is a rather complicated question as you put it,
Mr. Walter, and I think would require a rather complicated answer.268COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREI don't want to make harangues.on this--INDUSTRYIf you are asking me for my opinion
Mr. WOOD. As I recall the question, he simply asked if Mr. Collins'statement yesterday that he was instrumental in recruiting you in theCommunist Party is true or false.
Mr. SALT. If the question is that simple, then the framework ofthe question, I think, should also be that simple, without an elaborateprejudgment of guilt.
Mr. WALTER. We are not interested in convicting anybody of anything. That is not our function. We are seeking information becausewe feel we are confronted with a very serious menace to the securityof our Constitution that you have seen fit to get behind.
Mr. SALT. Or stand in front of.
Mr. WALTER. Or stand in front of, as you like, but neverthelessyou are using it for the purpose of not aiding this committee. Did
Mr. Collins recruit you into the Communist Party ?
Mr. SALT. Well, again, Mr. Walter, put in that very simple form,the answer must be the same. I must decline to answer on thegrounds of the fifth amendment, which I choose to stand in front of.
Mr. WALTER. That is all.
Mr. WooD. Mr. Moulder.
Mr. MOULDER. Committee counsel, Mr. Tavenner, asked you aboutan individual-was it John Stapp ?
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes.
Mr. MOULDER. How do you spell it?
Mr. TAVENNER. S-t-a-p-p.
Mr. MOULDER. I am not asking if you are acquainted with him, butdo you know who the gentleman is ?
Mr. SALT. Same answer.
Mr. MOULDER. Do you refuse to answer?
Mr. SALT. I refuse to answer on the grounds of the fifth amendment.
Mr. MOULDER. The fact you may know who he is or what he isengaged in, your knowledge of that might tend to incriminate you?
Mr. SALT. Perhaps. I just realized Mr. Moulder was not in theroom when there was testimony relative to the individual John Stapp.I think if the Congressman had been here he would understand.
Mr. MOULDER. You have heard of him before ?
Mr. SALT. I have heard his name in this room, and therefore declineto answer any questions concerning him.
Mr. MOULDER. Is that the extent of your knowledge of John Stapp,just what you have heard in this room ?
Mr. SALT. Same answer.
Mr. MOULDER. As I understand, you are a resident of what State?
Mr. SALT. California, Mr. Jackson's district.
Mr. MOULDER. What is your age ?
Mr. SALT. Thirty-seven.
Mr. MOULDER. Thirty-seven. Were you in the military service during the last war ?
Mr. SALT. No: I was deferred as 4-F.
Mr. MOULDER. The question was asked you about a certain numberof a Communist card. I want to ask you whether or not you arenow a member of the Communist Party. Are you now a member ofthe Communist Party ?269COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY
Mr. SALT. I think that the same answer must be given to this, which:is that I decline to answer on the ground previously stated.
Mr. MOULDER. In the event of an unprovoked military attack uponthis country by the Soviet Union, would'you feel your allegiance tothis country and join the defense of our country against such an:attack ?
Mr. SALT. This is another question that would tend to lead into aharangue, I am afraid.
Mr. MOULDER. That is a simple question.
Mr. SALT. No; I don't believe it is a simple question at all.I thinkit is probably the major question facing the country today, don't you,
Mr. Moulder?
Mr. MOULDER. Do you wish to answer the question, or do you declineto answer the question ?
Mr. SALT. I would like to answer the question if I may. My answerrequires some qualifications, because I do think it is an extremelyserious question.
Mr. WOOD. Do you mean it would take a lot of explanation to answer-that?
Mr. SALT. Yes; because it is a presumptive question.It presumes%awar, and I think the presumption of war is the psychological equivalent of advocating preventive war.
Mr. MOULDER. 1y question was, in the event of an unprovokedmilitary attack by the Soviet Union against this country, would youfight in defense of this country, the United States of America?
Mr. SALT. Again I say this is a highly speculative question, Mr.Moulder, and I think it is the kind of speculationMr. MOULDER. I don't care to argue with you. Do you believe inor now advocate the overthrow of or a change in our present formof Government by force and violence ?(Representative Harold H. Velde entered the hearing room.)
Mr. SALT. The gentleman on the wall at my left [indicating picture],
Mr. LincolnMr. MOULDER. That is evading my question.
Mr. SALT. No; I don't think it is. You have asked a question thattouches certainly to the deepest part of myself, a question that touchesmy deepest loyalty to my country-Mr. PoTTER. To our country, you are referring to, the UnitedStates?
Mr. SALT. If you are an American citizen, which I presume you tobe, being a Congressman here, then it is "our" country, obviously.
Mr. POTTER. Then why can't you respond to the gentleman's ques-tion?I am responding to the question. It enters the largestpossible political field, which is the field of advocacy.
Mr.SALT.
Mr. MOULDER. You have stated that in some countries you couldproudly answer the questions propounded to you by counsel of thecommittee, such as whether or not you are now a member of the Communist Party, have ever been, and many other questions. You statedthat in some countries you could proudly answer those questions, butthat you couldn't in this country that you purport to have so muchdevotion to. In what country or countries could you proudly answerthe questions ?270COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY
Mr. SALT. I am not speaking of myself. I said those questions couldbe answered by the citizens of those countries. I am a citizen of thiscountry.
Mr. MOULDER. You would have no hesitancy in answering the ques-tion in the Soviet Union, would you?
Mr. SALT. I don't know. I have never been there. I have no plansto go there. I was thinking in particular of a country like France, acountry like Britain, our allies.
Mr. MOULDER. And Russia?
Mr. SALT. I was not thinking of Russia.
Mr. MOULDER. That is all.
Mr. WooD. Mr. Doyle.
Mr. DOYLE. I think you heard the testimony of the witness yester-day. You were here throughout the hearing yesterday, I believe?
Mr. SALT. I believe so.
Mr. DOYLE. And the day before?
Mr. SALT. I believe I was here. I didn't hear everything, but I washere.
Mr. DOYLE. The reason I asked the question, then you heard myquestion on each day to some of the witnesses, in which I called attention to the law under which this committee operates. Did you hearmy question on that point ?
Mr.
Mr.
Mr.
Mr.SALT. I have a written statement I would like to read.DOYLE. Will you please answer my question?SALT. It would have bearing on your question.DOYLE. I haven't asked the question yet. Were you in thehearing room and heard my question?
Mr. SALT. Yes.
Mr. DOYLE. It doesn't call for a written statement, does it?
Mr. SALT. NO, but I have a written statement and I think it mightbe in orderMr. DOYLE. Let me ask the next question as long as you have an-swered that you were present in the hearing room the last couple ofdays. I call to your attention that under the law under which Congresshas asked this committee to operate and make report about, it providesthat we shall investigate and examine into "the extent, character, andobjects of un-American propaganda activities in the United States"which disseminated either from foreign countries or within thiscountry.And I think I called attention yesterday to the fact that the commonly accepted definition of "subversive," and the definition given by
Mr. Webster in his dictionary, is "To cause utter ruin, destruction; tooverthrow from the foundations."I will ask you as an American citizen whether or not you feel it isin any way improper, or not to the best interests of our Nation, thatthis committee should undertake in good faith to examine into theextent of any activities by any person or any group of persons whomay be interested in subversive activities designed to overthrow thefoundations of our American form of government? Do you understand my question?
Mr. SALT. I believe I do. It is rather long, but I think I followedit. The undertaking in good faith by the Nation and by the people'selected representatives to search out and punish the acts of subver-COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY271sion, I think is one of the highest and most worthy things that couldbe.done. I think it has been done in the past, and I think that Congress has certainly accomplished very important things. I am thinking particularly of the La Follette committee under Roosevelt.I think this question of good faith that you put is a very seriousquestion. I remember the debate on the law that you read from, andin that debate I recall that I believe the author of the legislation, Mr.John Rankin, said that the vote showed that the Members of Congressare in favor of having a vigilante committee. "I," Mr. Rankin said,"took up this fight where he left off."
Mr. DOYLE. You are reading, in part, from the sheet that you pulledout of your pocket awhile ago that you wanted to read ?
Mr. SALT. No. I am reading from a small note.
Mr. DOYLE. I put that term "good faith" in my question for yourbenefit and for the benefit of the committee, because we are seekinggood-faith answers by patriotic American citizens. So I deliberatelyput that phrase in it, "in good faith," the same as I did the other day,because I sort of gathered the inference from what you have said andfrom what some of the other witnesses have said before, that theyhad an idea this committee was not acting in good faith in trying touncover the subversive activities of persons or groups. Is that youropinion, that we are not acting in good faith?M'r. SALT. Well, I would not like to go into the motives or advocaciesof this committee any more than I want or believe this committee hasthe constitutional right to go into my advocacies. I can only discusswhat I believe to be the fact of the actions of the committee over itshistory, the witnesses that it has called, their character and kind, andthe results of the committee's activities.
Mr. DOYLE. Well, I don't know whether to assume that you arenot willing to answer the question of whether or not you feel thecommittee is in good faith in its work?
Mr. SALT. If you insist on my personal opinion, I would be happyto give it to you.
Mr. DOYLE. Well, I stated frankly to you that I am under the im-pression, and some of the other witnesses have felt, that the committeeis not in good faith.
Mr. SALT. Then I will give you my direct answer, Mr. Doyle. Basedon the entire record of this committee, which has been rather supported than repudiated by the present membership, based on the kindsof witnesses that from time to time have been brought forward hereand their testimony accepted without any serious cross-examination-such as the known perjurers, Larry Doyle and Harper Knowles; amurderer called McCuiston; Gerald Smith; the members of the Motion Picture Alliance in Hollywood--on that basis I can only say thatI must draw my own conclusion for myself that the investigationsare not in good faith.
Mr. DOYLE. Then my assumption is correct.I assumed from thevery start as you began to testify today that you were testifying, inpart, at least, as you did because you felt this committee was not ingood"faith; and apparently I was correct in that assumption; wasn't I?Well, I just wish to say this, Mr. Salt. There was a time, as I un-derstand it, when this committee did not allow witnesses before it tohave their own counsel. I was one of the Members of Congress that272COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRYstrenuously opposed that procedure in this committee when I firstcame to this Congress, and I would still oppose if it the committee undertook now to deny witnesses the right of counsel in the hearing room,as you have today.I state that to you simply because I want you to realize that I amone of the members of the committee that has undertaken-and I amsure all of the present members of this committee have undertaken-ingood faith to be factual and to establish the truth, whatever it is.We are not undertaking to persecute. I don't know of a singlemember of this committee that is interested in persecuting any citizen; but, on the other hand, I will state frankly to you as a residentof the State of California that I am interested in this definition ofWebster. and under the law as it is written to help ferret out anyperson or any group of persons who are interested, either presentlyor past or in the future, in subversive misconduct or propaganda.That is what this committee is designed to do and what it will do..I heard yesterday and the day before witnesses of your own profession testify that in their judgment the Communist Party of theUnited States was interested in the overthrow of our form of constitutional government, and in the face of that sort of testimony, whichhas not been contradicted by you or any other person, who claims theprivilege of the fifth amendment and is unwilling to state whether ornot you have been or are now a member of the Communist Partyin the face of that attitude toward you men and women who mayor may not be members of the Communist Party, but at least claimthe privilege when we ask you about it, I am constrained to concludethat the'Communist Party in the United States of America is interested and has been, according to their own testimony as members ofthe Communist Party, in the forceful overthrow, if necessary, ofthe American form of government which has borne you and whichhas borne me.Thank you very much.
Mr. WooD. Any further questions? Mr. Velde ?
Mr. VELDE. I have no questions.
Mr. WOOD. Mr. Jackson?
Mr. JACKSON. I have just a couple of questions.
Mr. Salt, you are employed by Norma Productions; is that myunderstanding?
Mr. SALT. No. That was terminated as soon as my subpena wasmade public.
Mr. JACKSON. Who is the head of Norma Productions?
Mr. SALT. Norma Productions is an independent company, I believe, made up of Harold Hecht and Burt Lancaster.
Mr. JACKSON. When was your last employment at R-K-O, Mr. Salt ?
Mr. SALT. It was just before I went to work on this. I would saythat it was 3 or 4 months. I am not exactly sure of the date. I wasrushing to finish one screen play to move over to another.
Mr. JACKSON. Was that in 1950?
Mr. SALT. I think it probably was; yes.
Mr. JACKSON. What script were you engaged on at R-K-O?
Mr. SALT. I finished the screen play of The Day They Gave theBabies Away.
Mr. JACKSON. Who hired you at R-K-O ?
Mr. SALT. Eddie Granger.COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY
Mr.JACKSON.273Now, during the period of time that you were withthe OWI, who was your immediate responsible superior, Mr. Salt?Who supervised your work generally ?
Mr. SALT. That is a very difficult question to answer.I am sure.that you all have some memory of the complications in those years. Ithink that the responsible Government man who was a civil-servicerepresentative was Mr. Smith. The chief of production was RobertRiskind, who left during the period that I was there, because the warended in Europe. He was followed by his assistant, whose name Idon't remember.
Mr. JACKSON. To whom did you hand your completed work on aday-to-day basis or week-to-week basis?Who received the script?
Mr. SALT. Well, it couldn't be done that way. I would have toexplain the actual process and work of production. A documentaryfilm is quite different in its production form than an entertainmentfilm, at least the documentaries made there. Usually it is based onfilm already taken which is there that is being put together, put intosome kind of, hopefully, artistic entertaining form. The writergoes along with this, helping to suggest arrangements of the filmand preparing commentary to go with it. At several stages alongthe way, in each of the projects we were on on the San Francisco Conference picture, for instance, we were in New York. The Conferencewas in San Francisco.The film came to us 3 days later. We nat-urally read all of the daily teletype releases and tried to plan a pictureon a conference while it was going on, because the office in Washing-ton was very anxious to have some kind of a picture at the end ofthe Conference for use.So that there was no immediate day-to-day supervision, but therewould be rather frequent discussions of the material, supervision ofthe material, in a projection room, by either Mr. Riskind or the manwho followed him. We brought the print to Washington for generalapproval and discussion. There was an advisory board of policywho also would move in from time to time to discuss this. There was.the whole OWI staff, which was on Fifty-seventh Street. We wereon Forty-fifth Street.So that I would say that the number of people who were in day-to-day contact with the film, every few days or every week, wer morepeople than you would find-in Hollywood, actually.
Mr. JACKSON. That is not an unusual situation in Washington.In common with some of the other members of the committee, Mr..Salt, I am sorry that you have seen fit to stand upon your unquestionedright to refuse to answer many of the questions which have been askedthis morning in many of which I see no possibility of self--incrimination.In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, I would just like to say that I feelthat when Mr. Salt walks out of this committee room, if he is in anymanner incriminated by his refusal to answer many of these questions,that that incrimination will be a direct result of his refusal to answerthe many questions which have been asked and to which truthfulanswers could in no way have incriminated him.
Mr. SALT. Well, I don't know. It has been an old family traditionthat you don't try to lay blame but seek out the root of the problem.
Mr. JACKSON. That is precisely what this committee is attempting-274COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRYto do. If we simply sit here and thumb non-cooperative witnesses ontheir way to courts of proper jurisdiction from whence they continueon to jail, we are not fulfilling our function of obtaining information.I personally should hate to see this committee become a whistlestop on the way to jail, because we are not going to find out anything.The only things we find out are from these people who come in hereand talk.
Mr. WOOD. Mr. Potter, do you have any questions ? I want to givethe members a chance to answer this call.
Mr. POTER. Mr. Salt, do you belong to the Ku Klux Klan organi-zation ?
Mr. SALT. No; I do not, Mr. Potter.
Mr. PorrER. Do you belong to the Communist Party or are you amember of the Communist Party ?
Mr. SALT. I am sure that the Congressman understands the verywide difference there.
Mr. POTTER. You answered my first question very easily, and thesecond question can be answered just as easily.
Mr. SALT. Well, as a witness, I feel that I am in a rather unfairsituation here because it is a trick question. I would like to be ableto answer it honestly. I do have to claim the privilege on the lasthalf of the question.
Mr. POTTER. In other words, you claim the privilege of the fifthamendment to my question as to whether you are now a member ofthe Communist Party. Is that correct ?
Mr. SALT. Yes.You are a young man and you have done fairly well
Mr. POTTrr.in this country of ours. Many men have had to give a lot more thanyou for the freedom which we are interested in, and many men todayof your age are giving a lot more than you have ever given.That is all, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. WooD. The committee will take a recess for 30 minutes.Unlessthere are further questions, you may be excused.(Witness excused.)(Whereupon, at 11:25 a. m., the hearing was recessed until 11: 55a. m., at which time the following proceedings were had:)
Mr. WOOD. Let the committee be in order.Let the record show that there are resent, of the members of thecommittee, Mr. Doyle, Mr. Jackson, Mr. Potter, Mr. Kearney, and
Mr. Wood, a quorum of the full committee.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Paul Jarrico.
Mr. WooD. Mr. Jarrico, will you please raise your right hand andbe sworn.You solemnly swear the testimony you give before this committeeshall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so helpyou God?
Mr. JARRICO. I do.TESTIMONY OF PAUL JARRICO, ACCOMPANIED BY HIS COUNSEL,ROBERT W. KENNY AND BEN MARGOLIS
Mr. TAVENNER. You are Mr. Paul Jarrico ?
Mr. JARRICO. That's right.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you represented by counselCOMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY275
Mr. JARRICO. Yes; I am. By Mr. Margolis and by Mr. Kenny.
Mr..TAVENNER. Will you please state your full name, place of birth,and your age.
Mr. JARRICO. Well, my full name is Israel Paul Jarrico, though Iam known personally and professionally and legally as Paul Jarrico.I was born in Los Angeles, Calif., on January 12, 1915, and I reside at320 South Sherbourne Drive, Los Angeles 48, Calif.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you give the committee a brief statement ofyour educational background ?
Mr. JARRICO. I was educated in the public schools of Los Angeles.I attended the University of California at Los Angeles, the Universityof California at Berkeley. I graduated from the University of Southern California in 1936 with a degree of bachelor of arts.
Mr. TAVENNER. How are you now employed ?
Mr. JARRICO. Well, until 2 weeks ago I was a screen writer.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was your last employment?
Mr. JARICO. I was employed at RKO Radio Pictures until the dayI received a subpena from this committee.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you give the committee a statement of youremployment record, please?
Mr. JARRICO. Well, it is a rather long one.
Mr. TAVENNER. Briefly.
Mr. JARRICO. I will try to summarize it. I first obtained employ-ment in the motion-picture industry in 1937, and have been employedmore or less continuously since by practically every studio in Hollywood, except for a brief time I spent in the merchant marine and ashort time I spent in the United States Navy.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was the last screen play on which you wereemployed?
Mr. JARRICO. The last screen play on which I was employed was TheLas Vegas Story, which is currently shooting in Hollywood, withJane Russell and Victor Mature. I urge you all to see it.
Mr. TAVENNER. By what company were you employed?
Mr. JARRICO. RKO Radio Pictures.
Mr. TAVENNER. Who employed you?
Mr. JARRICO. I was employed by the studio.
Mr. TAVENNER. The studio must have had an official representative,of course, in making the employment. Who was he ?
Mr. JARRICO. Well, my immediate producer was Mr. Robert Sparks.However, I must protest at this point. It seems to me an attempt tocreate the basis for a blacklist in Hollywood, on the basis of guilt byemployment, guilt by the mere fact that you employ a man.
Mr.Sparks, a conservative gentleman, I am sure, employed me becausehe thought I was the best man to do that particular job, and not be-cause of my politics.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you engaged in screen-play writing alongwith Richard Collins ?
Mr. JARRICO. Yes. He was my collaborator for several years.
Mr. TAVENNER. Over what period of time was he a collaborator withyou?
Mr. JARRICO. From the fall of 1941 until the summer of 1943.
Mr. TAVENNER. You were present, I believe, at this hearing roomduring the giving of his testimony yesterday ?81595-51-pt. 1---15276COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY
Mr. JARRICO. Yes; I was.
Mr. TAVENNER. I suppose you heard his testimony, in which he.stated that you were a member of the Communist Party
Mr. JARRICO. I heard his testimony in regard to a great many things.I heard him attempting to purge himself before this committee andperjuring himself before this committee.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did he perjure himself in regard to his statementthat you were a member of the Communist Party
Mr. JARRICO. I refuse to answer that question on the grounds that itmay tend to incriminate me.
Mr. TAVENNER. Then what did you mean by stating that he perjuredhimself in his testimony here ?
Mr. JARRICO. I refuse to answer that question, also, on the samegrounds.
Mr. TAVENNER. And what is that ground ?
Mr. JARRICO. That it may tend to incriminate me. That doesn'tmean that it would incriminate me. It just means that it might tendto; that it might subject me to prosecution, not to conviction.
Mr. TAVENNER. In other words, for you to answer the questionwould put you in fear that you might be prosecuted for some criminaloffense?
Mr. JARRICO. It might place me in jeopardy; yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. When did you receive your subpena to appear beforethis committee ?
Mr. JA.RICO. I believe the date was March 23. I am not completelycertain. I believe that is the correct date.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you confer with Mr. Collins about his ap-pearance-Mr. Richard Collins, about his appearance before this committee after you were served your subpena to appear here ?
Mr. JAmuco. I refuse to answer that question on the same ground.
Mr. TAVENNER. When you referred to Mr. Richard Collins "perjur-ing himself" before this committee, were you referring in any way tohis testimony as to the occasion when you visited him with regard tohis testimony before this committee ?
Mr. JARRIco. I have already refused to answer the same question,phrased rather differently. I believe it is the same question. At anyrate, to make it clear, I refuse to answer this question also, on the sameground.
Mr. TAVENNER. You refuse to answer in what particular?Youhave in mind with regard to Mr. Collins' testimony when you saidthat he perjured himself before this committee ?
Mr. JARRICO. That's correct.
Mr. VELDE. Counsel, is the word "perjured" or "purged"?
Mr. JARRICO. I used both words. I used "purge" and "perjury."I think the line between them is very thin.I wonder if I might at this point introduce a statement, Mr. Chair-man. I have sat here all day yesterday and heard my patriotismmaligned, my loyalty impugned. I wonder whether I might read afairly short statement, which states quite concisely my attitude towardmy country and toward this committee.
Mr. WooD. We are giving you the opportunity to answer whateverquestions are asked you here, which are intended to reflect on that verysubject matter. At the conclusion of your testimony, we will be happyCOMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE, INDUSTRY277to have you file for the record here any statement that you desire tomake.
Mr. JARICo. I can only answer the questions that are presented tome when I am being cross-examined. However, in my statement I amable to make a more considered statement of my position.
Mr. WooD. Following the custom and practice of the committee, youwill be given the privilege of filing that statement with the committeefor the record when you have finished your testimony.
Mr. JARRICO. I would like to reply publicly.
Mr. WooD. In this connection, sir, I would like to, if I may, Mr.Counsel interpose at this point this observation: Perjury is a rathergrave offense, not only under our law but under every moral code thatI know anything about. Now you have leveled a charge against a manthat you say was your collaborator for several years in the same industry that you are in; that he has deliberately committed that offensehere before this committee yesterday.Don't you think, when you make that charge yourself, that you oweit to yourself; you owe it to Mr. Collins; you owe it to the Americanpeople, and particularly the people in your industry, to inform thiscommittee as to just how and in what manner you contend that heswore falsely before this committee yesterday? Don't you think, infairness to every conception of decency and common justice and honesty, that you owe it to the people of America, and particularly in yourindustry, to let them know in what particular you claim he sworefalsely?
Mr. JARRICO. I shall issue a statement and otherwise communicate.
Mr. WooD. You are under oath now. Under your oath you havesworn that he committed perjury. One or the other of you is swearingfalsely. He has pin-pointed his testimony. Don't you think you oughtto pin-point yours ?
Mr. JARRICO. This is not my forum, Mr. Chairman, and this is notthe place for me to discuss my differences with Mr. Collins. I don'tchoose to do it here.
Mr. DOYLE. May I suggest this: I think, Mr. Jarrico, you were notbeing questioned by our counsel or by anyone else as to whether ornot it was your opinion that Mr. Collins had perjured himself. Youvolunteered the statement to this committee. We were not asking youwhether or not he perjured himself. You yourself volunteered thecharge that he perjured himself.
Mr. JARRICO. I was asked a question based on an assertion that Mr.Collins made here yesterday. I answered that question by saying thatI refused to answer that question, and that I refuse to consider Mr.Collin's testimony here as truthful. Now, that is my position. Idon't intend to discuss with you wherein it was untruthful or whereinit was truthful.
Mr. DOYLE. The only reason I brought it to your attention is thatyou volunteered the charge that he had perjured himself. We hadnot asked you whether or not he perjured himself or testified falsely.I just wanted to make that suggestion to you.
Mr. JARRICO. My answer stands, sir.
Mr. WooD. Continue the questioning.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you now or have you ever been a member of theCommunist Party ?278COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY
Mr. JARRICO. I refuse to answer that question on the ground thatit might tend to incriminate me, as I shall refuse to answer any question regarding my political affiliations or activities.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr.'Chairman, I have no further questions.
Mr. WOOD. Any questions, Mr. Doyle?
Mr. DOYLE. I think I have one or two for the gentleman. The state-ment that you were born in Los Angeles means that you are alsoa native son, as I am, of California,.
Mr. JARRICO. I am.very proud of it, Mr. Doyle as you are.
Mr. DOYLE. I note you also graduated from USC, and so did I.Weare both American citizens. I assume, Mr. Jarrico, that you wouldbe interested in helping this committee to uncover any person or anygroup of persons who were subversive in their attitude toward theconstitutional form of government in our Nation. Is my assumptioncorrect?
Mr. JABRIoO. Mr. Doyle, I should be happy to help this committeeuncover subversion, but one man's subversion is another man's patriotism. I consider the activities of this committee subversive of theAmerican Constitution.
Mr. DoyiE. Well, I assumed you did when you refused to answer aminute ago.(Representative Harold H. Velde left the hearing room.)
Mr. DOYLE. Now, as long as this is.a committee in good faith under-taking to serve our Nation, I am going to ask you a frank question.I think no member of the committee has asked quite this kind ofquestion.Why do you feel this committee's function is subversive of Americanrights and citizenship ? You have made a statement that we are unAmerican. That means that under Webster's dictionary we are undertaking to overthrow the foundation of our constitutional government. You realize that; don't you ?
Mr. JARRICO. I certainly do.
Mr. DOYLE. In what way is this committee undertaking to over-throw the constitutional form of government of this Nation?
Mr. JAmuRco. Well, if I might read my statement, I think it coversthat point very specifically.
Mr. DoYLE. Well, I am not asking you to read a statement. As longas you prepared a statement, you certainly are qualified to answer myquestion briefly, not to read a dissertation.You made a pretty serious charge, under Webster's definition of"subversiveness," when you say this committee is subversive in itsconduct.
Mr. JARRICO. Sir, I believe this country was founded on the doctrineof freedom, the right of a man to advocate anything he wishes-advocate it, agitate for it, organize for it, attempt to win a majority for it.And I think that any committee that intimidates people, that makesit impossible for people to express their opinions freely, is subvertingthe basic doctrine of the United States and of its Constitution.
Mr. DOYLE. And does your philosophy go to the point of feelingthat the'United States Congress, when it created this law, Public Law601, and set up this committee, was controverting and destroying therights of American citizens ?COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY279
Mr. JARRICO. I am certain that Congress had no such intention.However, 10 of my friends, very dear friends, have gone to jail forcoming before this body and saying that Congress may not investigatein any area in which it may not legislate, and since the Constitution ofthe United States specifically states that Congress shall make no lawrestricting the freedom of speech, and since countless decisions of thecourts have held that this provision of the Constitution means thatCongress cannot investigate into areas of opinion, of conscience, ofbelief, I believe that in asking that those men be cited for contemptof Congress and in successfully sending these men to jail, that thiscommittee has subverted the meaning o7 the American Constitution;yes.
Mr. DOYLE. Those 10 men were cited and convicted under the lawsof our country, and when the courts held them guilty, were the courtssubversive, in your opinion ?
Mr. JARRICO. The Supreme Court never ruled on the basic doctrineinvolved. I would like to think that some day it will, and that thestand that the 10 took will be recognized historically along with thestand that Jefferson took against the alien and sedition laws.
Mr. DOYLE. Well, now, let me ask you this question: Do I under-stand your testimony correctly then that when the Federal court heldthese 10 men guilty that you hold that that court was subversive ofthe rights of American citizens?
Mr. JARRICO. The courts have made errors before.
Mr. DOYLE. I am asking you a fair question.
Mr. JARRICO. I do not blame the courts. I blame this committee forits attempt to deny people the right to their opinions.
Mr. DOYLE. Yes, but this committee was not the Federal court. Iam asking you a frank question, whether or not the federal court wasguilty of subversive conduct when it held these men guilty.
Mr. JAmRICO. The courts also upheld the alien and sedition laws.The courts also in the famous Dred Scott decision upheld slavery.
Mr. DOYLE. I am asking you a fair question, am I not? If it is nota fair question, tell me so and I will ask you another question.
Mr. JARRICO. I have said that the courts in upholding the contemptcitations against these men, in my opinion, contributed toward thegeneral destruction of liberty in this country.
Mr. DOYLE. All right.
Mr. WOOD. Just a moment. Let the record show that Mr. Jackson,a member of the committee, has departed the committee, but there isnow present Mr. Velde, which still constitutes a quorum of thecommittee.
Mr. DOYLE. I will ask you another question, Mr. Jarrico, and ifyou think the form of my question is not fair I want you to tell me so,because I am trying in good faith to be fair. I am not trying to takeany advantage of you or lay any groundwork for any persecution.I think you said that you believed that the American citizen hadthe right to advocate anything he wished to ?
Mr. JARRICO. That's correct.
Mr. DOYLE. Do I understand, therefore, that you think an Ameri-can citizen has the right to advocate the forceful overthrow of ourconstitutional form of government ?280COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE
Mr. JARRIco. I believe he may advocate it.INDUSTRYI believe that it is un-likely he will get a great response to such a thing. I want to makeit clear that I am personally opposed to the overthrow of this Government by force and violence and to the use of force and violence.However, President Lincoln said that the people of this country havethe right to revolution, if necessary, if the democratic processes areclogged, if the people can no longer exercise their will by constitutionalmeans.
Mr. DOYLE. Do you know of any organization in the United Statesthat is regulated from within the United States that advocates theforceful overthrow of the constitutional form of government? Doyou know of any organization that does ?
Mr. JARRICO. Well, the McCarran Act, the Smith ActMr. DOYLE. I am asking you about an organization. Do you knowof any organization?
Mr. JARRICO. I am answering that question, sir. I am saying thatvarious acts passed by the United States Congress have defined certain organizations as organizations which advocate the overthrowof this Government. I do not necessarily agree with these definitions.
Mr. DOYLE. I am not asking you whether you agree with the definition or not. I am asking you as man to man in good faith whetheror not you know any such organization. I am assuming that youas an American citizen are interested in protecting our Americanform of government against forceful revolution. If my assumptionis wrong, of course the basis of my question is wrong. I am not asking you whether or not you are a member of any such organization,you notice. I am not asking that question. You have stood on yourconstitutional right under the fifth amendment. I am not asking youin that area. But I am just assuming as man to man that you, if youknow of any organization in America that favors that policy, in goodfaith will come out and tell us so.
Mr. JARRICO. Well, sir, this committeeMr. DOYLE. Do you know of any such organization ?
Mr. JARPICO. According to this committee, every organization thathas advocated peace in this countryMr. DOYLE. Just a minute. That question can be answered "Yes"or "No." We have other witnesses from Hollywood here. We wantto have them be heard, too, so they can get home over the weekend.
Mr. JARRICO. By your definition, sir, every organization that hasstood for decency and progress, the New Deal, against discrimination,for peace, and so on-these organizations are all allied with anorganization which advocates the overthrow of this Government. Ido not accept that definition.
Mr. DOYLE. In other words, you don't accept the definition of Mr.Webster's dictionary.
Mr. JARRICO. Yes, I do accept the definition of Mr. Webster.
Mr. DOYLE. I am asking you whether or not, under the definition of
Mr. Webster, you know of any organization in this country that advo-cates what Mr. Webster says is subversive conduct, that's all. Thatis what I am asking you. I am assuming that you want to help protectthe American Government.
Mr. JARRICO. If I knew of such an organization, sir, I should helpyou to expose it.COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY281
Mr. DOYLE. Do you know of any individual that is interested inthat?
Mr. JARRICO. If I knew of such an individual, sir, I should help youto expose him.
Mr. DOYLE. All right. Now, one more question. In answer to ourcounsel you stated that you believed that our functioning as a committee was to form the basis of a blacklist. Why do you believe thiscommittee is interested in blacklisting people so they can't get employment, if they are honest, patriotic citizens. Is that your statement?
Mr. JARRICO. You are not interested in that end, but you had betterrevise your methods, because your methods have had that end. I knowof many people who are blacklisted in Hollywood as a result of thehearings in 1947, and I know that today the basis is being laid for anincrease of that blacklist, so that anyone who has advocated anythingprogressive is going to be a suspect. And the Motion Picture Alliancefor the Preservation of American Ideals, quaintly named, is going tobe the organization in Hollywood that decides who shall work and whoshall not work, what pictures shall be made and what pictures shall notbe made, and this is an organization that upholds this committee andthinks it is doing a splendid job in exposing so-called "Reds."
Mr. DOYLE. What is the name of that committee ?
Mr. JARRICO. The Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation ofAmerican Ideals. You should know it very well, Mr. Doyle.
Mr. DOYLE. But I don't happen to know it, sir. You see, there aremany of us, Mr. Jarrico, in spite of your assumption, that are just asmuch interested as you are in protecting the rights of American citizens and are just as progressive and just as patriotic toward liberalthinking, whether you believe it or not.I wish to. state-I know for myself, and I state it for myself and Istate it for every member of the committee-that we are not interestedin blacklisting anyone. I wouldn't be true to my duty as a citizen if Iallowed you to charge that we are without denying it. But I will saythis: My own belief is that you gentlemen who come to this committeeand unalterably claim the fifth amendment and the first amendmentwhen we get into the area of questioning you about the organizationsyou have been or are members of, are making it very difficult for thiscommittee as a committee of Congress to function.
Mr. JARRICO. I feel I am defending the Constitution, sir, and nothiding behind it. I feel that sincerely. And I feel that if you weresincere in your declarations against blacklisting that you should makeit plain that people who claim their constitutional privileges shouldnot be discriminated against in Hollywood, because Hollywood has theimpression that you intend everyone who is called before this committee and who does not cooperate with this committee to be drivenfrom the industry.
Mr. WooD. Mr. Jarrico, I must at this point challenge that statement, ih the interest of the members of this committee, with whom Ihave served for some time and for whom I have the highest regard.No man has ever come before this committee yet and answeredtruthfully and frankly the questions that have been put to him whohas ever, to my knowledge, been injured thereby. If people are beingdeprived of any rights or privileges of employment because of theirappearance before this committee, it has been because of matters that282COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRYthey themselves have brought out, and not this committee. If beinga member of a subversive organization and admitting such causes aman to lose some employment rights, that is his responsibility and notthis committee's. If he declines to answer whether he has or not andthereby loses employment rights, that likewise is his responsibilityand not this committee's. This committee has never yet been responsible for any man being a member of any organization, subversive orotherwise.The only thing on earth that this committee has ever attempted todo or is attempting to do now is to ascertain, under the functions it ischarged with carrying out by the very act of the Congress that createdit, what activities in the realm of subversiveness in this country aregoing on and who is being responsible for it.
Mr. DOYLE. I wish to thank my distinguished chairman for makingthat clarification.May I ask you one more question, Mr. Jarrico ? The law states thatthe purpose of our investigation is to report to Congress any necessaryremedial legislation in the field of subversive conduct. Have you anysuggestion of any remedial legislation that we should report to Congress ? It states that in the law. That is why I am asking you in goodfaith.
Mr. JARRIco. Well, I have one. You might revise your guide tosubversive organizations and publications issued by this committee.It includes, for instance, the Hollywood Democratic Committee, andwithout wishing to embarrass you, Congressman Doyle, perhaps youremember that that committee contributed to your campaign andwrote speeches for your campaign. It is listed here as a subversiveorganization.
Mr. DOYLE. I don't remember that. I don't think I had any knowledge of it. I have many friends in Hollywood, both in and out of theindustry. But be that as it may, have you any suggestion as to howthe functioning of this committee should be remedied? That is whatI am asking you. How shall we revise the list if we can't get the helpof people like you that are informed? How can we get the help toremedy the legislation?
Mr. JARRICO. Well, I think that if you made it absolutely clear thatyou were defending the first amendment and the fifth amendmentand the people who defended those amendments, instead of subjectingthem to blacklisting and other liability, that you would be doing a greatservice to the country.
Mr. DOYmL. Well, I wish to state this, and this is my final question.I am very sure, Mr. Jarrico, that no member of this committee is interested in any way less than you are in protecting the rights of theAmerican citizens under the first and fifth amendments. But apparently your considered opinion and conclusion differs with that ofmembers of the committee as to ways and means in which we arecharged with doing that.
Mr. JARRICo. Well, I can't see where you can pretend for a momentthat you are protecting the first and fifth amendments when everything you have done is directed toward abridging them, curtailingthem, limiting them, subverting them.
Mr. DoYLE. This is my final question, Mr. Chairman.Do you mean then that this committee in calling you, for instance,as a typical case-that when this committee subpenas you to comeCOMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY283and be questioned about what you know, if anything, about subversivepeople or organizations, that we are controverting your constitutionalrights under the first and fifth amendments?
Mr. JARRICo. I certainly do.
Mr. DOYLE. Then you take the position that the Congress has noright to call people before it and to question them as to their philosophy and whether or not it favors the forceful overthrow of our Government?
Mr. JARRICO. Congress has no right to legislate in this area. It can-not pass any law restricting the freedom of speech, and therefore ithas no right to investigation in this area. It cannot inquire into aman's opinions, his attitudes, his beliefs of any kind. That is my firmposition; yes.
Mr. DoYLI. Well, the reason I pressed you for your opinion is thatI feel that the committee should have considered opinion. As longas you stand on the first and fifth amendments, I wanted the basisupon which you stood.
Mr. JARRICO. You have it, sir.
Mr. KEARNEY. Can you tell me the name of the producer of Out-rageous Story?
Mr. JARRIOo. I alredy have introduced that name into the recordunder protest. It was Robert Sparks.
Mr. KEARNEY. Can you tell me who the script writer was?
Mr. JARRICO. I was.
Mr. KEARNEY. And the director?
Mr. JARRIco. Robert Stephenson. Again I wish to say that youare trying to intimidate these people.
Mr. KEARNEY. Just a moment. I want to ask a question.question I want a "Yes" or "No" answer.To thisDo you believe the Communist Party is dedicated to the overthrowof the United States Government by force or violence?
Mr. JARRICO. I refuse to answer that question on the grounds previ-ously stated.
Mr. KEARNEY. That is all, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. WooD. Mr. Potter?questions for the witness ?
Mr. TAVENNER. No, sir.
Mr. Counsel, do you have any further
Mr. WOOD. Do you want to hold the witness for further questioninglater or should he be excused ?
Mr. TAVENNER. I suggest he be excused.
Mr. JARRICO. May I introduce my statement now, sir?
Mr. WOOD. File it with the reporter.(The statement referred to was filed with the records of thecommittee.)
Mr. TAVENNER. Mrs. Meta Reis Rosenberg.
Mr. WOOD. Raise your right hand.You solemnly swear the testi-mony you give before this committee shall be the truth, the wholetruth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God.Mrs. ROSENBERG. I do.
Mr. WOOD. Be seated, please. For the purpose of examining thiswitness, let the record show that the same number of the committeeare present: Mr. Doyle, Mr. Velde, Mr. Kearney, Mr. Potter, and
Mr. Wood.284COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRYTESTIMONY OF META REIS ROSENBERG
Mr. TAVENNER. You are Mrs. Meta Reis Rosenberg?Mrs. ROSENBERG. That's right.
Mr. TAVENNER. You spell your middle name R-e-i-s?Mrs. ROSENBERG. Right.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mrs. Rosenberg, will you state where you wereborn?Mrs. ROSENBERG. In San Francisco, Calif.
Mr. TAVENNER. What has been your educational background?Mrs. ROSENBERG. Well, we moved to Los Angeles when I was veryyoung, and all of my early education was in Los Angeles publicschools, and I went to Hollywood High School in Hollywood. Thatis the extent of my educational background.
Mr. TAVENNER. By the way, are you represented by counsel?Mrs. ROSENBERG. Yes; I am.
Mr. TAVENNER. If you desire to confer with them, you may do soat any time.-Mrs. ROSENBERG. Thank you.
Mr. TAVENNER. How have you been employed,Mrs. Rosenberg,during the period in which you were engaged in professional work?Mrs. ROSENBERG. Well, originally, about 1933 or 1934, I was employed by Fox as a reader, and then in 1935 and 1936 I was in NewYork representing a motion-picture agency by the name of SmalLandau, and I went back to Hollywood and worked for WarnerBros. as a reader in 1937 and part of 1938, when I quit my job toget married. Then I resumed working in 1940 for Paramount as aspecial reader.
Mr. TAVENNER. You began that assignment when?Mrs. ROSENBERG. 1940.
Mr. TAVENNER. 1940 at Paramount?Mrs. ROSENBERG. Paramount. And then I became head of thereading department at Paramount, and then I became assistant storyeditor at Paramount.
Mr. TAVENNER. When did you become the story editor at Paramount?
Mr. ROSENBERG. Well, I imagine it was about-it must have beenaround 1942. I must have been there 2 years before I became one ofthe story editors. I was assistant to a man called Bill Dozier atParamount. Then I stayed at Paramount until 1945, when I askedto be released from my contract, and I went to a motion-picture agencyby the name of Berg-Allen Berg. There I became head of theirliterary department, where I was until 1949, in February. And Ihaven't worked since. I have been a wife and mother.
Mr. TAVENNER. Then you became a member of the Hollywoodgroup, we may say, when you returned from New York about 1937?Mrs. ROSENBERG. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. At the time you returned from New York, wasthere an organization in Hollywood by the name of the Joint AntiFascist Refugee Committee?Mrs. ROSENBERG. I believe there was.
Mr. TAVENNER. Was there also an organization known as theHollywood Anti-Nazi League?Mrs. ROSENBERG. Yes; there was. Of that I am sure.COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY285
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you ever a member of these organizations?Mrs.ROSENBERG. No;not to my knowledge.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you attend their meetings ?Mrs. ROSENBERG. Yes; I did, their public meetings. Since I wasnot a member of the organization, I didn't attend any of the boardmeetings or committee meetings, but I did go to their public meetings; yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you interested in the particular programs ofthose groups?Mrs. ROSENBERG. I was very interested; yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was the nature of your interest?Mrs. ROSENBERG. Well, during the Spanish Civil War I had a verystrong feeling for the Loyalists, and I was interested in hearing thepoint of view of any organization or finding out any information thatI could regarding the Loyalist fight. As far as the Anti-Nazi Leagueis concerned, I felt that it was terribly important at that time to makethe American people aware of the nature of the fascism in Germany and the menace to peace and people over the world.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, did you follow up your interest in the Anti-Nazi League by becoming interested in any other organization whichseemed to make its cause the same cause of the Anti-Nazi League?Mrs. ROSENBERG. Well, as a matter of fact, I did. I had gone toa number of meetings of the Anti-Nazi League or an organizationI don't remember the name of it. I think it might have been calledthe Motion Picture Artists Committee, which people like Bob Montgomery and Frecdie March and Melvyn Douglas were associated withfor Spain. I .was also very interested in the reelection of Rooseveltand in the continuation of his policies at that time.I met a woman who was known to me then as Madelaine Ruthven.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you spell the last name.Mrs. ROSENBERG. R-u-t-h-v-e-n. And she told me that she was amember of the Communist Party, and she explained to me that theCommunist Party-which was something I already understoodthat the Communist Party was backing the Loyalists in Spain. TheCommunist Party was very active in support of Roosevelt, and theCommunist Party was the most militant organization in the UnitedStates in terms of their opposition to Hitler in Germany, and in termsof educating the American people to this. And she told me thatsince I already believed in these things, which I did, and that theCommunist Party was the most effective organization to work forand against those things I believed in, that she thought I shouldjoin it, because she felt it was perfectly ridiculous for someone to havethese strong beliefs and not do anything positive about them, thatone must make a positive step. This seemed perfectly reasonable tome, and I did join the Communist Party in 1938.
Mr. TAVENNER. You joined after your conversation with the per-son you just referred to-Mrs. ROSENBERG. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER (continuing). As Madelaine Ruthven?Mrs.ROSENBERG.That's right.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you know what position she held within theCommunist Party?Mrs. ROSENBERG. NO.
Mr. TAVENNER. Or what function'she performed?286COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRYMrs. ROSENBERG. I am not absolutely, sure. She was some sortof an executive of the party. That I understood. But the partystructure has never been terribly clear to me, so I am not absolutelysure. I think she might have been what is known or what was knownat that time as an organizational secretary, but I am not sure. Ithink that is probably what she was, sort of in general charge of personnel and detail.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, now, as a result of her invitation to you tounite with the party, were you received into the party and assignedto a cell or group of the party ?Mrs. ROSENBERG. Yes. I went to a meeting, the first meeting Iever attended, where a man by the name of John Howard Lawsonwas in charge of the meeting, and I understood that he was also incharge of the Hollywood group of the Communist Party. And Iwas assigned to a group of people. I mean I was assigned to meetwith a group of people, with whom I did meet.I must qualify this by saying that I only met with them for a while,because this was in 1938, and in July-I don't know what monththis was. It was probably early in 1938-but in July of 1938 I gotmarried to a man called Irving Reis, who was not then nor to myknowledge has he ever become a member of the Communist Party.And so when I got married to him I sort of became inactive. I wasmore interested in my marriage than I was in party activities, and fora long time I didn't go to any meetings nor did I even join any outside organizations during this period or before it. I had never beena member of any of these organizations.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, now, will you tell us the names of the personsin the group of Communist Party members to which you were assigned when you first joined the party ?Mrs. ROSENBERG. As I remember it, there was a Frank TuttleFrank and Tania Tuttle. He was married to her at that time; heisn't now. Waldo Salt, Paul Jarrico.
Mr. TAVENNER. Paul Jarrico ?Mrs.ROSENBERG. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. Waldo Salt?Mrs. ROSENBERG. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. He is the same Mr. Salt who testified here thismorning, or were you present ?Mrs. ROSENBERG. I wasn't present, but I assume that he is the same.Paul Jarrico.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did you see the witness on the stand who immediately preceded you?Mrs. ROSENBERG. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. IS it the same person?Mrs.ROSENBERG. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. Proceed, please.Mrs. ROSENBERG. Sam Ornitz.
Mr. TAVENNER. Sam Ornitz ?Mrs. ROSENBERG. O-r-n-i-t-z. Herbert Biberman, Dorothy Treeand her husband, Michael Uris, and a man called Francis Faragoh,F-a-r-a-g-o-h, who is a writer.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did the woman Madelaine Ruthven also attend thegroup meetings?COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE, INDUSTRY287As a matter of fact, I shouldhave mentioned her. I met often in her home. I left her out. Shedid attend. She was active.
Mr. TAVENNER. To whom did you pay your Communist Party duesat that particular time?Mrs. ROSENBERG. Yes; very often.
Mr. ROSENBERG. At that time I believe I paid them to MadelaineRuthven.
Mr. TAVENNER. You stated that you were only with that group afew months before you retired temporarily.Mrs. ROSENBERG. That's right.
Mr. TAVENNER. How many meetings do you think you attendedduring that period ?Mrs. ROSENBERG. Oh, I really couldn't say.I attended some meet-ings and then I got married, and for a while I was inactive, and thenI began to go to meetings again.
Mr. TAVENNER. Did all of these persons whose names you have men-tioned attend one or more of those meetings with you ?Mrs. ROSENBERG. Oh, yes; yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. How long was it before you returned to the attend-ance of meetings?Mrs. ROSENBERG. What happened was that in 1940, when I went towork for Paramount as a reader and eventually became assistant storyeditor, which put me in touch with most of the writers in Hollywood,since this was part of my job involved in stories and writers, when warwas declared the following year, after war was declared by the UnitedStates, an organization was formed called the Hollywood Writers'Mobilization about 1942. I think this must have been early in '42.And I undertook an assignment for this organization which wasdirectly in sympathy with the organization, and so was I, not onlywith the Government at that time but with the Communist Party atthat time. There was no conflict in my mind in terms of the attitudesof the party toward the war effort and the attitudes of the Government toward the war effort. There was no conflict at all. There wasa no-strike clause. There was every interest in the party in seeing thatpeople did as much work as possible for the war effort.So I joined this organization in a capacity in which I felt I couldbe of most value, which was to-I was in, charge of getting all thematerial, not all the material but a good deal of the material writtenfor those stars who went on camp tours and hospital tours in thiscountry and overseas. This was mostly comedy material, as youprobably remember, and I was a kind of liaison between the Writers'Mobilization and two organizations, one called the Victory Committee,which was the producers organization for such activities, headed byEddie Manix, Charlie Feldman, Kenneth Thompson-all very conservative men, I hasten to add-and the USO Camp Shows organization, headed by a man named Abe Lastfogel, who was in charge of theWilliam Morris office. And what they would do was they would sayOlivia De Haviland was to go on a camp tour in this country. "Wouldyou get some kind of little routine worked up for her?" I would calla writer and I would get the writer together with De Haviland, andwe would discuss what was best suited to her personality and her typeof talent, and something would be written for her. It would be givendirectly to either USO Camp Shows or to the Victory Committee,and that would be the end of it.81595-51-pt. 1-10Off she would go.288COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRYThere were hundreds and hundreds of actors and actresses who entertained during the war, as you know, and there had to be a great dealof material written, and I was in charge of it.
Mr. TAVENNER. Now that was immediately after this country be-came involved in the war?Mrs. ROSENBERG. That's right.
Mr. TAVENNER. During that period of time were you attendingCommunist Party meetings ?Mrs. ROSENBERG. I did attend some during that time; yes. I attended a few, simply because I felt that since I was doing what I couldfor the war effort, and since that thing was the primary issue in theparty at the time, there wasn't any particular reason for me to go toall those mobilization meetings, that I had to go to meet with all thosepeople that I had to meet with, and also go to Communist Party meetings where they were discussing the same things, as far as I was concerned. So I attended meetings, but not very many.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were those meetings of the same group that youhad formerly been assigned to or a different group ?Mrs. ROSENBERG. No; they were different people than during thewar.
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, tell us about your assignment to the secondgroup and when that occurred.Mrs. ROSENBERG. Well, I don't -exactly remember, Mr. Tavenner,when it occurred, but was probably sometime around 1941, and it wasin connection with the Writers' Mobilization work, because most ofthe people in the group had some connection with the mobilization.
Mr. TAVENNER. Just a minute. You say, "most of the people inthe group"?Mrs. ROSENBERG. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. What group ?Mrs. ROSENBERG. In the second group.
Mr. TAVENNER. Of the Communist Party?Mrs. ROSENBERG. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. Had some connection with the Hollywood Writers'Mobilization ?Mrs. ROSENBERG. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. Very well. Tell us who were in this second groupand, in giving us the names of them, state also whether or not theywere connected with the Hollywood Writers' Mobilization, and ifyou can recall, in what capacity.Mrs. ROSENBERG. Well, the first one that comes to my mind, the mostnatural one, of course, is Robert Rossen, who was the second chairmanof the mobilization. There was Abe Polonsky. I don't know thathe had any special job in the mobilization. He did a good deal ofwork. He is a very brilliant writer.
Mr. TAVENNER. Abe Polonsky?Mrs. ROSENBERG. Yes; Polonsky. There was Albert Maltz. I don'tremember whether Maltz worked in the moblization or not, but Iremember him in the meetings.. There was Lester Cole. There wasRichard Collins. There was a man named Carleton Moss, who madea film for the Capra unit, an excellent film, as a matter of fact, on theNegro soldier in the war effort-the Army unit known as the Capraunit, headed by Frank Capra. Gordon Kahn. I don't rememberCOMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY289whether Kahn was active in the mobilization or not, but I rememberhim in these meetings.The point is, you see, it is difficult for me to remember about themobilization. The mobilization was an organization made up of allofficially recognized writers' groups in the industry, which meant thatevery writer in the industry was a member of the Hollywood Writers'Mobilization and was working for them, and the mobilization didwork for the OWI, for the Navy, for the Army. They did propaganda work for all the Government agencies engaged in this type ofwork. And I am trying to restrict now my memory to those peopleI knew as Communists, and I think those are the only ones that I canmention.
Mr. TAVENNER. Those are the only ones ?Mrs. ROSENBERG. Those are the only ones I know.
Mr. TAVENNER. Who were members of your cell and who were alsomembers of the Writers' Mobilization ?Mrs. ROSENBERG. Those are the people that I saw in Communistmeetings; yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. I would like to ask you if you knew an individual bythe name of Edward Biberman.Mrs. ROSENBERG. Yes; I did. I was in.meetings with him. He wasnot a writer, and as far I know had no connection with the mobilization. He was an artist, painter. He is Herbert Biberman's brother.
Mr.TAVENNER.Well, now, can you recall the name of any otherperson who was a member of this group who was not connected withthe Writers' Mobilization ?Mrs. ROSENBERG. The only other person I can remember that mighthave been a member of this group-and I don't hesitate to say thatI knew him as a Communist. It was just simply in one group Iknew him, and I think this is not terribly important-is a man bythe name of George Willner, who was an agent, a literary agent, witha company called Nat Goldstone.
Mr. TAVENNER. Would you spell t7 kat name ?Mrs. ROSENBERG. W-i-l-l-n-e-r.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you recall his first name?Mrs. ROSENBERG. George.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were you acquainted with these individuals priorto your being assigned to the group with them ?Mrs. ROSENBERG. Some of them, yes; because of my work in themobilization, and some of them I had simply known as writers in theindustry.industry.After all, I was in contact with most of the writers in the
Mr. TAVENNER. I would like you to state to the committee just whattranspired at the meetings in as general a way, with such particularsas you can recall, relating to any things that would indicate the typeof control that the Communist Party had over its members.Mrs. RosENBERG. Well, at that time, Mr. Tavenner, the control wasmore over its members in terms of general attitude than it was on anyissue of politics, because, as I have said before, there was no conflictbetween the people who were in the party and the people who werenot in the party as to the issues of the day.
Mr. TAVENNER. You are speaking now of the war period?290COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE' INDUSTRYI am talking of the war period, between '41 and'44. There was, however, a general attitude on the part of the morevocal people in the party to hand down decisions which were neverreally discussed. In other words, the discussions which were heldwould end pretty much as they started, and it took me a long time,I am afraid, to finally understand that this was the type of disciplinethat was entirely, in my opinion, undemocratic and which I couldnot uphold or agree with, either in its principle or in its policies.For instance, I was one of the people who was confused and bewildered and somewhat shocked in 1939 by the Nazi-Soviet Pact.I had joined the party on the basis of being anti-Hitler. Naturally,this came somewhat as a suprise to me, and it was explained to methat this was an expedient measure on the part of the Soviet Unionto gain time; that there was never a question in their mind but whatthey were going to fight the Germans. It was just a question of gaining time. I accepted this.There were other switches of this sort, as you are all well aware,Mrs.ROSENBERG.from time to time; and I found it more and more difficult to accept,simply because if you are thinking independently it is very difficultto go from one opinion to another quite so quickly.Finally in 1944 or '45, I think it was, the Duclos letter was issued.This was another shock to me.
Mr. TAVENNER. D-u-c-l-o-s?Mrs. ROSENBERG. Yes. Duclos was a French Communist who didn'tquestion but who challenged the policy of the American CommunistParty.
Mr. TAVENNER. It was his challenge that was accepted as the properCommunist Party line to be adopted in this country ?Mrs. ROSENBERG. That's right. Now one of the things-and it willprobably sound naive-that disturbed me most, since I really had noreally great political understanding of these things-one of the thingsthat disturbed me most was that here was a group of people who hadfelt that Earl Browder was a very great and important man oneminute, and after the Duclos letter they didn't say, "Here is a manwho has made a mistake. We cannot any longer accept his leadership, so we will replace him," in what would seem to me to be legiti-mate terms if that is the way they felt. They turned one minutefrom thinking this was a very great man to the next minute of tearinghim limb from limb and practically crucifying him. This was thekind of thing I couldn't understand.So finally I felt that it was about time in my life that I thoughtfor myself, and I realized that in the party this is not really possible.I would like to illustrate this with what is to me a particularly pertinent quotation. There is an Italian by the name of Ignazio Silone,who is a very great Italian novelist, who was an important party member up until around 1929 or 1930, who was in fact a member of theComintern with Togliatti, who is presently the head of the Communist Party in Italy. Silone left the party in 1929 or 1930, and I recently read a statement of his on why he was in it and why he wasout of it, and he said this. He said that in the Communist Partythere is no such a thing as an adversary in good faith; that even witha man of the stature of Lenin, whom Silone obviously considered aman of great stature, one could not really disagree with any reasonable intelligent terms. The minute you disagree they begin to callCOMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY291you names, and this is a form of intimidation, this is a form of fear,and people have a dreadful desire to belong once they belong to something. And this is in my opinion a very bad and a very dangerous policy of any organization. I consider it one of the most dangerous policies of the Communist Party-that there is no really independentthinking among the rank and file.This was one of the most decisive reasons for my leaving, outsideof the fact that, when I left in 1945, I not only disagreed with theprocedure in the party but I disagreed with their policy.(Representative Francis E. Walter entered the hearing room.)
Mr. TAVENNER. Well, now, will you tell the committee just whatinduced you to leave the party and how you left it ?Mrs.ROSENBERG.Well I have already told the committee to the bestof my ability what induced me to leave. I felt that I could no longerbelong to an organization which I had joined for what seemed to methe highest motives, and then I found out that-I had always believedthat if an organization was anti-Fascist in the best possible sense thatit must naturally then be prodemocratic in the best possible sense, andwhen I found out that it was not I was naturally disenchanted, shallwe say. I was no longer interested.
Mr. TAVENNER. How did you go about terminating your relationship with the party ?Mrs. ROSENBERG. Well I hadn't been going to meetings for a longtime. I had been going to meetings irregularly during the war, notfor reasons of politics but simply because I was so busy with warwork; and after that I just began to skip meetings one after anotheraround 1944, and I asked for my release from Paramount in 1945my release from my contract.
Mr. TAVENNER. DO you recall when that was in 1945 ?Mrs. ROSENBERG. It must have been around August. I had a coupleof years to go on my Paramount contract, but I felt that I had goneas far as I could go in the organization, because it isn't really possiblefor a woman to be a front-office executive in a major studio, and Ifelt that I would rather be in an agency where there is really no discrimination against women, where a woman can be as important anagent as a man. So I left Paramount and went to an agency calledBerg, Allen Berg, which I have mentioned before, in 1945. I musthave gone there around September, and not very long after I went, aman whom I had never met, whom I had never seen, came to see me,a party functionary by the name of John Stapp. He asked me whyI had not been coming to meetings for so very long and what I intended to do about it, and I told him I intended to get out, that Ididn't intend to come to meetings at all any more; and that was theend of it.
Mr. TAVENNER. Do you recall about how long that was after youtook the employment with the agency ?Mrs. ROSENBERG. It must have been a very short time, I think.Probably not more than a month.
Mr. TAVENNER. When do you consider you had actually withdrawnfrom the party ?Mrs. ROSENBERG. Well, spiritually I had withdrawn before that;but I had not actually said so to them. I simply hadn't gone tomeetings.292COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY
Mr. TAVENNER. I would like to go back.a little and ask you moredetailed questions about your experience while in the party.Youhave spoken of the procedure in the meetings and the imparting ofthe Communist Party line to the group.Now, how was that line imparted ? Were there ever occasions whenhigh functionaries of the party addressed your group ?Mrs. ROSENBERG. Yes.For one thing, I remember very early inmy experience in the Communist Party around 19-you will havea record of this date. I wouldn't, because I didn't keep records.About 1939, it must have been, a man called Carl Winter, who wasa party functionary from New York as I understood it, a member ofthe central committee, came out and addressed a meeting at whichI was on party matters. I don't actually remember the issues thatwere discussed at that time. I simply remember that I did meet. himat that meeting. I never saw him again.
Mr. TAVENNER. Were there any others whose names you can recall?Mrs. ROSENBERG. Well, John Howard Lawson very often would cometo the meetings, even if he were not a member of the particular group,in order to explain certain problems that had arisen, of certain projectswhich they felt were important.
Mr. TAVENNER. What in your opinion was the thing in Hollywoodwhich the Communist Party was really after?Mrs. ROSENBERG. Well, I think there were two things, mainly.Ithink the first one was that they felt that by getting important writers,actors, producers, and so forth, important people in the motion-pictureindustry who were well known to most people in the country, or atleast whose names are seen on screens all over-I think that theyfelt that by getting the complete sympathy and support and activityof these people that they themselves would gain prestige in thecountry.I also think that because these people earned large sums of moneythey probably felt that it would be a very important'thing to be ableto get money, because they solicited funds all the time. They askedfor money all the time, not only in terms of dues but for special things.If the New Masses were in trouble, which it seemed to be constantly,they were asking for money, and I think that probably the CommunistParty in Hollywood was able to give them quite a good deal.
Mr. TAVENNER. What about your own party dues?Mrs. ROSENBERG. At the time I was in the party I was working atParamount. I wasn't making a great deal of money, and I didn'tpay much in dues. Originally when I joined the party I was a reader.I was making very little money, and I paid very little amount, andfor a while I didn't pay any, because I had no money of my own andmy husband, not being a member of the party, was not particularlyinterested in supporting it. He didn't disagree with those anti-Hitler,pro-Roosevelt, anti-Franco sympathies of mine, but he was not interested in the Communist Party. So I couldn't honestly ask him tosupport it.When I went to work for Paramount I earned a little more money,but it never was much at any time. When I went to Berg-Allen BergI wasn't a member of the party any longer.
Mr. TAVENNER. In other words, you virtually withdrew from theparty at the timeMrs. ROSENBERG. Yes.COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY293
Mr. TAVENNER (continuing). That you went to your new employ-ment?Mrs. ROSENBERG. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. Now, at the time that you were in Paramount andwhile you were in the Communist Party, did you meet a person by thename of Bea Winters ?Mrs. ROSENBERG. Oh, yes. Bea Winters was hired at Paramount,not by me, but she was hired at Paramount. She had been a secretaryin the industry for a long time, an executive secretary, with an excellent reputation, and she was hired in the story department. Her jobwas to reorganize the story files, which were badly in need of reorganization at that time, and she did a really magnificent job of it.When I was head of the reading department I was automatically incharge of those story files for a while, and consequently she and Iworked together. She was my secretary. When I became assistantstory editor she was no longer my secretary.When I left Paramount to go to Berg-Allen Berg, Berg-Allen Berghad not for a long time had an official story department. They wantedto establish one again. They had writers, but they didn't have a realstory department,and I felt that their files were badly in need ofreorganization. The first person I thought of was Bea Winters, because she was awfully good at this. She was also a good secretary andI hired her.I read the testimony of Sterling Hayden saying that Bea Wintershad recruited him into the party. Now, during this time she was mysecretary at Berg-Allen Berg I did not know of her affiliation with theCommunist Party. I had never seen her in a meeting. I did know,however, of her leftist sympathies, because this was the sort of thingthat was discussed in general, and she felt the same way as a lot ofother people I knew, no more, no less. However, when I hired her atBerg-Allen Berg it was on the basis of merit rather than her politicalopinions. She left. She must have worked for me for about a yearand a half there, or so; and then she left to retire because she didn'twant to work any more at that time. She is working again now. I,however, had no knowledge of Sterling Hayden's membership in theCommunist Party. As a matter of fact, I didn't know about LarryParks either. It was interesting, because I was story editor at BergAllen Berg, and they were both clients. I couldn't have been more surprised. But of course I was out of the party then.
Mr. TAVENNER. While you were in the party and while working forParamount in charge of the reading department, were you in a position where you could, if you chose, favor any particular writer'swork in the work that you did ?Mrs. ROSENBERG. Not as head of the reading department, but Iwas in a position of some influence when I was assistant story editor.However, there are several things that have to be considered in thislight. One is that I had a very good reputation as a story editor, andI was very jealous of that reputation, and if I were to recommendwriters because I thought their politics were similar to mine and theydidn't turn out good scripts, I would not only not have a good job, but Iwould not have a good reputation.Another thing was that in no major studio is it possible for anyonein such a position to really exercise very much influence, because, for294COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRYinstance, in Paramount, Y. Frank Freeman was the head of the studio,and at the time I worked there Mr. Da Silva was under him, and also
Mr. Ginsberg.
Mr. TAVENNER. What Da Silva?Mrs. ROSENBERG. Buddy Da Silva. He has since died. And Henry Ginsberg after him. And there are producers; there are directors;there were two front office executives above me. There was Mr. Freeman, and there was Mr. Ginsberg, all of whom were very concernedabout what writers were hired and what stories were bought andknew as much as I did about these things.My main interest was in doing a good job, and there was no reasonfor me to hire people for political reasons. I was doing a war job,which I felt was enough for the party.
Mr. TAVENNER. Actually, during the period of the war when theCommunist Party was interested in promoting the war effort, therewas comparatively little occasion for the exercise of preference ?Mrs. ROSENBERG. There was no occasion for it. There was reallyno occasion for it. I haven't got the records, but the committee couldcertainly get them, I am sure, from Paramount. If you will go overthe list of writers who were hired and who worked at Paramount during that time, you will find no preponderance at all of "left" people.They were hired on the basis of could they fill the assignment orcouldn't they.We made such pictures as Wake Island, The Story of Dr. Wassel,Double Indemnity, Lost Weekend. These were pictures which mightbe considered propaganda, but hardly subversive.
Mr. TAVENNER. After your employment with Berg-Allen Berg, youwere then in a position of greater importance and greater responsibility, were you not ?,Mrs. ROSENBERG. Yes, I was; and I represented writers of everypossible political color. I represented people like Sinclair Lewis,James Hilton, Richard Llewellyn, Clement Dane, Laura Hobson. Isold books such as Belvedere, which was made into a Clifton Webbpicture called Sitting Pretty, and subsequently into several sequels;a book called East River, by Scholom Asch, and I sold Gentlemen'sAgreement to Zanuck. I was very proud again of the fact that I hada reputation as an agent, which was unique in the sense that I neverrepresented anybody I didn't believe had talent, and many peoplecame to me whom I refused to represent.I don't feel that it is my place to explain this to you, but I thinkif you will check with other people in the industry you can find thisout for yourselves.
Mr. TAVENNER. You have named a number of individuals there aspersons for whom you have sold pictures or writings.Mrs. ROSENBERG. Yes.
Mr. TAVEiNER. Were any of those persons whose names you havementioned members of the Communist Party?Mrs. ROSENBERG. Oh, no; I don't believe so.Certainly not to myknowledge, and I would be very surprised to hear it.I also represented Dalton Trumbo, who had been a client of BergAllen Berg's for many years before I came there, as was, for instanceAyn Rand. They represented anybody they felt was talented and.that they could do a job with. My association with Dalton at Berg-COMMUNISM INMOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRYAllen Berg was entirely professional.295He had a contract at that timeat Metro, and there was actually very little to do for him.
Mr. TAVENNER. The point that I want for the committee is whetheror not at any time, even after you left the Communist Party, youknowingly favored any Communist writer in the promotion of hisparticular writing or script.
Mr. ROSENBERG. Not to my knowledge.
Mr. TAVENNER. I have no further questions, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. WooD. Mr. Walter, any questions?
Mr. WALTER. No questions.
Mr. WooD. Mr. Doyle?
Mr. DoYLE. No, I think not, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. WOOD. Mr. Velde?
Mr. VELDE. You mentioned that the Communist Party, line repre-sented controlled thinking, or words to that effect. In your opinion,who controlled the Communist Party line? How did you get theCommunist Party line ?Mrs.ROSENBERG.Well, the people naturally-this is partly a ques-tion of leadership and partly a question of personality, because a manlike Herbert Biberman, who was not necessarily to my knowledge inany high position of leadership, talked a great deal; and when a mantalks a great deal and with a certain eloquence he can control otherpeople. But aside from that it was obvious to me that the personwho really did most of the thinking or of the deciding for the groupwas John Howard Lawson.
Mr.
Mr.
Mr.
Mr.WooD. Mr. Kearney?KEARNEY. I haven't any questions.WooD. Mr. Potter?PorTER. Mrs. Rosenberg, when you were working with writers,preparing the scripts for various USO personalities, you stated thatit was difficult to actually influence the script; is that true?Mrs. ROSENBERG. Well, they weren't really scripts, you see. Theywere just little comedy sketches. It wasn't even a question of influence. It was a question of what was the sort of thing that IngridBergman could best do to entertain soldiers. Could she dance or singor could she recite a poem? It was that sort of thing. It was a question of the capacity and personality of the stars.
Mr. PorrER. Was any effort made by Communist leaders in an effortto have you influence it? You said it wasn't done, but I am wonderingif that was ever suggested. Was it brought to your attention thatthis would be a good thing to do?Mrs. ROSENBERG. No.I must honestly tell you, Mr. Potter, thatthis was never done. Either I was in a field where it didn't seemadvisable or, as Mr. Tavenner has helped me explain, this was in aperiod where there was no conflict between the poliitcal policies ofthe party and of the Government.
Mr. PorTER. For my own information, what is a reader ?Mrs. ROSENBERG. Well, a reader is somebody who takes a novel,whether it is in galley form or an original story written for the screen,reads it and does a synopsis of it, ranging anywhere from 1 page to 50pages, for those people who are in executive charge of the studio whohaven't time to read the whole thing, because there are hundreds andhundreds and hundreds of such books and stories and plays sub-296COMMUNISMINMOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRYmitted monthly to studios. The people in charge simply haven't thetime to read everything themselves, and they need someone to boilit down for them, to say to them, "This is something you should lookinto," or "Don't bother about this."
Mr. POTTER. I will say that you brought a great deal of charm toour committee.Mrs. ROSENBERG. Thank you, Mr. Potter.
Mr. WOOD. I wish to express on behalf of the committee our deepappreciation for your coming here and the very frank manner inwhich you have answered the questions which were asked you.Unless there is some reason why she should be retained, we will excuse the witness.Mrs. ROSENBERG. I have a wire which I don't think should necessarily be introduced into the record, but it rather adroitly represents the attitude of some of my friends in Hollywood about mypolitical activities, and I will leave it to the discretion of the counselas to whether he wants to read it or not. It comes from a man calledNunnally Johnson, who is a producer and writer at Fox.
Mr. WooD. Suppose you leave it.Mrs. ROSENBERG. Let the counsel decide.
Mr. TAVENNER. I will certainly read it, Mr. Chairman, perhaps tosave the witness a little embarrassment:Mrs. META ROSENBERG,Statler Hotel, Washington, D. C.:I trust this will convince you that politics is no business for a fetching girl.Politics is for flat-chested girls. [Laughter.]
Mr. WOOD. Thank you very much. You may be excused.(Witness excused.)

Mr. TAVENNER. What has been your record of employment?COMMUNISM INMOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY297
Mr. KILLIAN. You mean Hollywood orMr. TAVENNER. Let us confine it to Hollywood.
Mr. KILLIAN. I went out there in 1935. I was under contract toColumbia Studios.
Mr. TAVENNER. Have you been there ever since?
Mr. KILLIAN. Well, not entirely. I made my residence there eversince, but I did go to New York on occasion to do an occasional playin New York.
Mr. TAVENNER. What was your last employment ?
Mr. KILLAN. My last employment was in a picture called- I believe it is going to be called The Tall Target, done at MGM.- A storyof the attempted assassination of Lincoln.
Mr. TAVENNER. Who employed you?
Mr. KILLIAN. The producer, who is Richard Gladstone.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you give us the names of other pictures inwhich you have participated?
Mr. KILLIAN. I have been in something like one hundred and twenty-five or thirty pictures. I can jump around. I cannot keep themchronological.
Mr. TAVENNER. Let us state some of the principal ones within thepast 3 or 4 years.
Mr. KILLIAN. The past 3 or 4 years ? I was in The Flame and theArrow. I was in a picture not yet released, something about goingdown into the bowels of the earth to escape atom bombs. I think thatwas called under production Night Without Stars. I was in a picture with Bob Hope. It was called The Lemon Drop Kid. It is notyet released, to my knowledge. I find it hard to remember them. Ican't offhand remember any. I know they are there.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Killian, the committee has information thatyou were issued a Communist Party registration card in 1945, bearingNo. 47342. Is that correct ?
Mr. KILLIAN. I am going to stand on the fifth amendment. I amnot going to spell it out for you, but I merely say I refuse to answerthat question on the grounds that my'answer might tend to incriminate me.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you now or have you ever been a member ofthe Communist Party?
Mr. KILLIAN. I refuse to answer that question on the groundspreviously stated.
Mr. TAVENNER. I have no further questions, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. WooD. Mr. Doyle?
Mr. DOYLE. Do you know, Mr. Killian, of any organization in ourcountry, the United States, which has for one of its objectives the subversive overthrow of our form of government? I am not asking ifyou are a member of any. I am asking you if you know of any.
Mr. KILLN. If I knew of any such organization, I would report itto the proper authorities.
Mr. DOYLE. One of the objectives of this law under which we serveis to make reports to Congress as to remedial legislation and connectit with subversive ,misconduct of persons or organizations. Do youhave any suggestion as to any remedial legislation ?
Mr. KILIAN. I am not equipped to do that at all. As I say, I ama person of very little education, and certainly no legal knowledge.298COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTUREINDUSTRY

Mr. MARGOLIS. Ben Margolis.
Mr. TAVENNER. Mr. Graff, will you state when and where you wereborn?
Mr. GRAFF. I was born in New York City, 1920, June 2. Spentmost of my life there. My father died in 1941. I was an only child.I had the support of my mother, who wasn't well, and we moved toCalifornia-Los Angeles.
Mr. TAVENNER. When did you move to California ?
Mr. GRAFT. That would be approximately June 1942.
Mr. TAVENNER. What is your profession?
Mr. GRAFF. A semiemployed free-lance actor.
Mr. TAVENNER. Will you state to the committee what your employment has been since you went to Hollywood in 1942, briefly. For whatcompanies have you worked ?
Mr. GRAFF. Before 1942?
Mr. TAVENNER. No since 1942.COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY299
Mr. GRAFF. Oh, since 1942. Under very peculiar circumstances asthese things work, I found myself with a contract with Columbia Pictures in 1944. I think it was February. That's right.
Mr. TAVENNER. And what was your next employment, or did youstill remain under contract with that concern ?
Mr. GRApF. Well, I remained under contract for the remainder ofthe year, at which time I was called to serve my country. I wasinducted into the United States Infantry, served, went overseas, returned, and was honorably discharged in 1946.
Mr. TAVENNER. After your discharge, what was your record ofemployment?
Mr. GRAFF. I had found 6 weeks remaining on my contract, and Ifilled them out at Columbia. I must say that during the time I wasthere I had gotten very little work. They had a plan for me whenthey first signed me on, possibly a starring moving picture. It fellthrough in the first week, and I hadn't worked since at the studio. Ireturned. They had no plans for me. I finished my 6 weeks, at whichtime I was suddenly out of work, dropped, no money, and having spenta little over a year at Columbia, I hadn't advanced in my career. I hadinvested time there. They paid me, and meanwhile I had been stillan unknown actor, unperformed.At that time I was very conscious of my rights as a returning GI,and felt honored to exercise those rights. And I found that in mybeing discharged, 6 weeks after my returning, that the bill of rightswas in existence and it guaranteed 52 weeks' employment at the studios,any place you worked, for any returning GI. I talked to my unionabout it. There was some hesitancy at first, but they finally agreed todiscuss it with the studio. The attorney got in touch with the studio.They had a conference, and as a returning soldier they still didn'trecognize the principle in the studio that I was entitled to the remainder of the 52 weeks, but they made the concession that they didn'trecognize it, but since it was right after the war they weren't going totest the case of a returning GI being entitled to begin his career again.
Mr. TAVENNER. When did you return to the west coast?
Mr. GRAFF. Return?
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes, from the service.
Mr. GRAFF. 1946. When I was discharged, I returned to my mother,who was alone, to take up the support. She wasn't well, and I wentback to work. February of 1946. Is that what you wanted to know?
Mr. TAVENNER. I am trying to understand the dates.
Mr. GRAFF. Oh, the dates. Is that what you want? I was discharged on February 1, 1946.
Mr. TAVENNER. When did you enter the service?
Mr. GRAFF. I entered the service in December 1944.
Mr. TAVENNER. Where were you between 1944 and 1946?
Mr. GRAFF. I spent 6 months in infantry training at Camp Roberts,Calif. I was then assigned for overseas duty as an infantry replacement trainee.
Mr. TAVENNER. About when did you leave the United States?
Mr. GRAFF. I left the United States-I can't remember the exactdate. It would be, I guess, in the early part'of 1945.

Mr. TAVENNER. In the early part of 1945?
Mr. GRAFr. Forty-five. I left on a transport and arrived in thePhilippines and was assigned to a replacement depot.
Mr. TAVENNER. And w~en you left, of course, you left from California for the Philippines?
Mr. GRAFF. Yes,\ that's right. That's correct. We boarded, Ibelieve, near San Francisco on a troopship.
Mr. TAVENNER. How long had you been in San Francisco prior toyour leaving for the Philippines? Were you stationed there
Mr. GRAFF. Oh, no. I have had no stationing in the United States,except for the training.May I say something? Would this gentleman [indicating newsphotographer] like a picture? You are just making me nervous. Youkeep looking at me, and I am trying to concentrate here.
Mr. TAVENNER (adressing news photographer). I think you shouldgo ahead and take your photograph.(Continuing to address the witness.) Now let us see if we understand each other. When was it you left the United States for serviceoverseas ?
Mr. GRAFF. Didn't you get that?
Mr. TAVENNER. No, I didn't.
Mr. GRAF. Approximately-it must have been around April orMay, perhaps, of 1945, I left this country. That's right. Didn't I saythat ?
Mr. TAVENNER. YOU said early in '45, I thought.
Mr. GRAFF. I see.
Mr. TAVENNER. Immediately before your leaving this country foroverseas service, where were you stationed?
Mr. GRAFF. I was stationed in the Philippines, outside of Manilaabout a hundred miles.
Mr. TAVENNER. Then I have again misunderstood you. I am sorry.I thought you left this country for the Philippines in early 1945.
Mr. GRAFF. Where was I stationed ? Didn't I say I had 6 months'infantry training at Camp Roberts?
Mr. TAVENNER. Yes. Were you still at Camp Roberts up until thetime that you left for the service overseas?
Mr. GRAFF. Yes, that's right. I had gotten a leave, you know, priorto overseas. I got my leave, which was for approximately 10 days,and I had gone overseas.
Mr. TAVENNER. Camp Roberts is in the southern part of California,isn't it?
Mr. GRAFF. Yes.
Mr. TAVENNER. A hundred or so miles from Los Angeles; possibly150 miles?
Mr. GRAFF. I think it is more than that. I used to spend my weekends practically doing all traveling to get home. It was approximately400 miles each way.
Mr. TAVENNER. Each way, but week ends you went to your home inLos Angeles?
Mr. GRAFF. Went home just about to sleep, eat, and go back.
Mr. TAVENNER. The committee has information,-Mr. Graff, that onDecember 9, 1941, there was issued to you a registration card of theCommunist Political Association which bears -number 47363. Didyou receive such a card ?COMMUNISM IN MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY301
Mr. GRAFT (after consulting counsel). I believe in the principle inrelation to the Constitution. I am always ready to defend it, and. Imust state that I feel that it is my duty as an American to claim thisprivilege that was invested in this country by people who have foughtor it, and that is the right to not testify to such questions because theymight tend to incriminate me today.
Mr. TAVENNER. To incriminate you ?
Mr. GRAFF. That's correct. And I might add that this right doesnot commit anybody to assume whether there is any guilt involved orwhether it is incriminating or not. I am sure you gentlemen are wellaware of that.
Mr. TAVENNER. Are you now or have you ever been a member of theCommunist Party?
